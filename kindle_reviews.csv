805767,B00I2GZRLG,"[0, 0]",4,"Lost in You by Sommer Marsdenis a sweet yet passion-filled romance between two unlikely lovers. Clover Brite and Dorian Martin come from completely different worlds, but neither can resist their smoking hot desire. Both are carrying their fair share of emotional baggage and their promising relationship is threatened by Clover8217s insecurities.Although Clover is the project manager for a renovation of one of Dorian8217s properties, the two meet for the first time during a super-storm. Trapped at the mall by the weather, there is an immediate attraction between them. Clover is quite flustered at first, but Dorian soon puts her at ease and pretty soon the two are indulging in some scorching hot sex. But once she and Dorian return to real life, Clover8217s issues jeopardize their fragile relationship.Insta-lust is rarely a firm foundation for a new relationship and in Lost in You, Clover and Dorian learn this difficult lesson fairly quickly. They are likable characters in the beginning, but once reality sets in, they become quite frustrating at times. Clover is young, but she has a heightened sense of responsibility which is a good thing for her career, but this spells disaster for her personal life. She also has unresolved issues stemming from her childhood and coupled with her awareness of the social differences between her and Dorian, she is quick to assume there is no future for them.Dorian is handsome, charming and refreshingly down to earth. He is in his mid-twenties and he is working hard overcome his playboy, party image. He never comes across as a snob or class conscious, so Clover8217s reaction to the differences between them has no basis in reality and he never gives up on trying to convince her to give them a chance. He always remains a likable character but his pursuit of Clover becomes a little manipulative at times. It is a real turning point when he finally stops pursuing Clover and leaves the future of their relationship in her hands.Although Dorian and Clover are sometimes exasperating, the secondary cast of characters is superb. Clover8217s grandmother and surrogate aunt Brani are absolutely wonderful. Their scenes are warm and witty and neither of them put up with Clover8217s negativity.  Older and wiser, their advice to Clover is spot on and thankfully, she finally begins to listen to them.Sommer Marsden beautifully redeems both characters into well-rounded, appealing characters and Lost in You concludes with a highly romantic and deliciously steamy happily ever ending that readers are going to love.I received a complimentary copy for review.","06 10, 2014",A3RHTYOGSITLWN,K.

He shows her he can be trusted, that he won8217t force himself on her and finally he tears down her walls.  Lucy allows him to love her tells him about her life with her Drake.  It wasn8217t an easy story to listen to or tell, with descriptions of broken ribs, bruises, horrible names he called her, but it was her story and Knox needed to know it so he could understand why she was so protective of her heart.Knox is furious and vows to protect her, which is good all of a sudden Lucy is attracting the attention of other men.  Lucy tries very hard to let go of the past, but things keep happening to remind her, then text messages, gifts start arriving.  It could only mean her ex found her, but how could that be, he doesn8217t know where she is.The author did a great job at developing characters we can relate to and fall in love with.  I instantly became a huge fan of Knox and I adored Lucy for her strength and willingness to not be a victim.  She was learning to trust and fight back.

Although the thought of returning makes him uneasy, Tony also realizes that the personal demons destroying his peace of mind need to be put to rest. It isn't long before Tony and Carlos realize that this increasingly bizarre case could involve supernatural elements. A visit to local witch, Lilith Adams, verifies that she's partly to blame for Tony's bad memories. The question is whether Lilith is involved in these suicides. Is she intending to help or thwart attempts to find the truth?Eye of the Witch is the second installment in a series that incorporates mystery, the supernatural, witchcraft, and even romance. The book is a police procedural mystery first, but one that  incorporates suspects and victims with unique abilities. Those abilities will stretch credibility with some readers while others will appreciate the creative means used to commit a crime.The book's strengths are its interesting premise and characters. Tony is complex and the author portrays his inner turmoil well. Carlos and his new partner Spinelli are also believable and likeable. Frequent references are made to events in the first book which have left an impact on characters in this installment, however, not enough backstory was provided to understand the complexity of the relationship between Tony and Lilith.

There is tons of sexual chemistry between him and Elena. Elena even if she is innocent knows she wants Searc. She does trust him and you can tell she is just afraid to tell him all.

I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that if we were going through a similar trial of our own, it would be almost too difficult to bear. In addition to that, the heroine, Katie is asked to perform an almost unspeakable task in the midst of her pain. That is a turning point for her, and shows her mettle and her character.The introduction of all of the other characters brought some fascinating layers to the story. These would be people that I would love to be around, and have around me when going through hard times. And times were hard in the 1800's. People needed each other back then. They weren't isolated like we are today, and through good times and bad, your friends, neighbors, and family were there for you. I found this enjoyable to read about.The author also skillfully wove moral values throughout without being preachy. Yes, there were Bible verses, but they applied to the story and also gave the book a soul, so to speak, that I have not found in reading other romance novels. I appreciated this, and found myself being drawn in by the characters, their lives, and the tragedies and triumphs that linked them all together.Well written, and full of edifying words--all the way to the satisfying end.","05 17, 2013",A2IJI1NDUT9LNU,floridabreezes,A Romance Novel with a Soul,1368748800,1.0,True,5.0

The two main protagonists are Joaquin, who is a vampire, and Ariana, a human.  The key to the beginning of this story is that Ariana has no idea that Joaquin is a vampire.  She knows he has some strange habits, but their lovemaking was great, and he was wonderful with her.  But then Ariana begins to get strange emails from someone unknown with comments about the man she is sleeping with....the man you are with isn't who you think he is.....Ariana pressures Joaquin to tell her more about himself, and he becomes suspicious and finds out about the emails.  He finally tells her that he is a vampire, and she laughs.  There is no such thing as vampires.  So she thinks..... Joaquin has feelings for Ariana, more then he has ever had for a human woman, and he asks her if she trusts him.  She leaves to take a walk, and that will be the last time either see each other for 6 onths.What happens thereafter is very exciting.  Charon is a powerful vampires, who wants to rule the world. She also has magical powers, given to her by a Shaman, making her even more powerful.  Charon wants Joaquin dead, as he is the only person standing in her way of taking control. She befriends Ariana, under the guise of protecting her against Joaquin, and then uses her powers to make Ariana think she has been beaten, and Charon  saved her.  Charon tells Ariana that she is a vampire hunter, and wants her help to save the world.  Using her illusions on Ariana to hide the fact that Charon converted her to a vampire, and trains Ariana to be a vampire hunter.Joaquin of course is still looking for the missing Ariana, with help from his friend Devlin.  Over the next few months, it becomes apparent that with the rise of vampire slayings, Charon has converted Ariana.  Of course, Joaquin can't understand why Charon is having her kill vampires, but over time he will see it is a plot to kill him.This was an excellent story, a different type of theme with Ariana not knowing what she was due to the illusions, and becoming an excellent fighter.  The story was very exciting, especially the last half of the book.  Charon was a good villain, and Ariana turned into a great heroine.  I really liked Joaquin, who really loved Ariana and would do anything to save her.  Great story, the best of this series so far, with excellent characters and a super ending.","08 1, 2012",A32HPEJOM37MF4,Barb thereadingcafe Barb,Wonderful and fun short story.,1343779200,1.0,True,5.0

They had made the decision to have a child, found the surrogate and gotten pregnant. But Cary's ex left him alone and struggling for reasons that reveal themself in the book, which just make you hate the guy even more. Cary's number one focus is little Gus and then his business the Dog Barkery. He hasn't dated since before Gus was born, and rarely hooks up. But there is something about the tall blonde that volunteers at the animal shelter that piques Cary's interest. When he meets his best friend out at a local gay bar for a drink, the last person he expects to see is Heath, the spine tingling sexy man from the shelter.Heath Cummings swings both ways, he's the if I'm interested in them the plumbing doesn't matter, type. Having married his best friend when they were young, dumb and got knocked up... only to loose the baby and almost his best friend, he has a strict 'no children' policy for the people he plays with. Yes, I said plays with, because Heath is out for numero uno only and the words commitment, love, and emotion are not in his vocabulary. That is until one tall, dark and handsome single father gets under his skin.A chance encounter ends with Cary in Heath's lap sans clothing at the Barkery, in Cary's office, and the two decide to use each other for weekly tire rotations. The sex is off the charts amazing, but soon both men find themselves getting more attached than the situation calls for. Cary is worried about bringing anyone into Gus's life, or falling in love with an emotionally unavailable man that will no doubt break his heart in the end. Heath is completely blown away by Cary, Gus and the every growing feelings he has for both of them. He didn't think he was capable of the love that he is starting to feel. And it scares the living crap out of him, literally. But communication is not either of these men's strong suit from the start, and one miscommunication too many threatens to implode their already fragile friendship.What an adorable, slightly angsty, definitely sexy, just a little quirky, sarcastic and emotional love story this was! I LOVED the inner monologue playing in Heath's mind at the start of the story. Boehme has this knack for creating realistically flawed characters and impossible relationships that turn into down to earth, good old fashioned love stories. Both men struggle for various reasons throughout, some of their reasons align while they also have very different reasons to doubt not only their ability to love, but to be loved as well. Boehme brought the emotions and the passion to the pages and had me hooked from the start and praying these two would pull their heads out of their {insert appropriate word here} and just commit to each other already!This is a must read for those that like a story that makes you feel because Keep Swimming will keep you reading, and feeling until the end.

With that being said the first few chapters of this book I found very hot the sex scene right off the bat put me in the mind of the 1st book Vanilla On Top.  It was my favorite part of the whole book.However, after that first scene I thought the sex scenes were just ok. I know their not BDSM but an exploration. The thing is you can do an exploration without doing the same ones you have already read half dozen times. I like uniqueness. I am however only 1 persons opinion. You judge for yourself.There was also some other things I didn't like about the book I thought Heather was a love struck teenager instead of the adult she is suppose to be. She turns out to not be my favorite character at all. She was always thinking of Tony 24/7 like she had no life of her own. Tony in my opinion was the whole focal point in this story since it really involved him and his ex.Now to talk about  the ending which was unpredictable of what was going to happen with Portia. However the ending was good but their was a lot of loose ends that needed to be tied up. Just seemed a lot to cram in the last few chapters and some things were left hanging. Making me think their will be another book of Tony and Heather.Overall I liked the book but I didn't love it thats why I gave it 4 stars.","02 25, 2014",A2C9QC8WE632LP,Melissa,I liked it but didn't love it,1393286400,1.0,True,3.0

From the opening paragraph I was instantly drawn into this amazing story.  It had just the right combination of drama, dream-worthy romance and steamy love scenes.Krista Lakes has done an exceptional job of creating characters you can totally relate to and instantly care about.

Probably because I once wanted to be a lawyer and I grew up watching Ally McBeal with my mom, but either way I gravitate to author's like Julie James and now I can add NM Silber to that list! You don't have to be a law fan to enjoy her stories or understand what's going on. She has a fantastic handle on dumbing down law jargon for us non-lawyer pleabs.She also has created a fantastic group of characters that are hilarious and intelligent! It's my favorite combo when reading. Added to that, her characters are sexy. And not in an overt way. It's sexiness without brow beating us. It's romance without throwing a sex scene in every five seconds to say, See? They have a relationship! Because that's not a relationship, people. I like my characters to go on dates. I like them to fight about menial crap. I like them to have fun together and be sweet to each other. I love the build up to the first time.We get all of that with this novel. We even meet the parents! Which is probably one of my favorite parts, at least when they go to meet Gabrielle's family because her grandmother is an absolute head case. Think of the grandmother from Wedding Crashers, but more outspoken and crazy.I love that we get to see the progression of their love for one another. The first installment in this series is brimming with humor, intelligence, sexiness, sweet moments, and intrigue. I enjoyed myself ever single second! 100% recommend this to everyone!The Home Court Advantage - 4 Stars!Ok so we pick up right where we left of in book 1. Can I be honest in saying that I A) didn't know that the second book was going to be about Braden and Gabby and B) don't really think they needed a second book? Let me be clear though, while I do think/thought those things, I still really enjoyed The Home Court Advantage. It had all of the things I really enjoyed from the first installment. Hilarious court cases, fantastic dialogue, witty flirting, steamy sex scenes, and crazy family members. What I enjoyed even more was seeing more of their friends, whom I'm hoping play leading roles in the books to come!As far as the stalker element goes, it seemed to be overshadowed by everything else in the novel. It just didn't seem like a strong enough storyline, especially since it's what brought on book 2. I kinda didn't care enough about it. I was too interested in everything else that was going on! So if you're one of the people who are reading this series for the mystery (who are you?!), you may be a bit disappointed.All in all, it was a very enjoyable read.

Braden is an Assistant District Attorney and Gabriel is a Public Defender, so they're on opposite sides in the courtroom, but they make up for it in the bedroom.Adam, Mark and Cam are Braden's friends and Jessie, Lily and Beth are Gabriel's.

The Embattled Road is the prequel to the series and centers around Marines Duncan, John and Chad, and how they were injured in battle and their immediate recovery. It also sets up the rest of the series by showing how the three of them come back together at the end.These three heroes each have physical and emotional challenges any Marine would have given the situation they lived through.

252620,B008FK66RI,"[0, 0]",5,"BACK TO NATURE is the first story in the book and is written by Cassandra Carr.  It certainly sets a tone for what to expect from the rest!  Our couple is in a firm Dom/sub relationship, which is exemplified beautifully.  He decides they're going to go have some public fun, so they go to a park and do all kinds of naughty things in various locations throughout.  The fun thing is that they're never itching for an audience, nor are they disappointed, or shy for that matter, whenever they get one.  Cassandra weaves a story that holds a perfect balance of erotica and loving devotion and it's really a beautiful thing.HAIL MARI is the next story, written by Jami Davenport.  This picks up from somewhere in the middle of the last story from the point of view of a spectator from one of the locations of a tryst from the original couple (I will refer to them frequently, as they are the catalyst for a park full of naughtiness!).  Mari and Wyatt meet up once a year whenever he's in town, always pushing her to venture into more and more unfamiliar territory sexually.  After catching sight of a couple on a park bench, they decide to have a little fun of their own.  This encounter however, will lead them to a new place emotionally.  It starts off seeming like it'll just be a horny couple, but instead turns into a potentially life changing experience.TAKING IT OUTSIDE is the third story and the only one written by Cristal Ryder.  What disappoints me is that this is the only one by her, as it was my favorite in the book.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed them all, but this one had emotion, heat, and comedy.  Val and Tyler have a strong relationship and a healthy sex life - one that encourages a little adventure from time to time.  Val sets a sexy picnic in the park and tells Tyler to meet her.  While waiting, she sees a shameless couple up on one of the lookouts above the lake.  She's already hot and bothered by the time Tyler catches up with her.  They visually follow the couple, and use their antics as inspiration for their own.  Little did they realize they weren't the only voyeuristic people in the equation.  They get the surprise of their lives at a cafeacute later that leads to a little embarrassment, but many laughs.A WHOLE NEW WORLD is the fourth story, returning to Cassandra Carr.  Once again we're in the minds of two people who happened to catch sight of our original couple when they actually thought they were alone.  It leads to Ross confessing an exhibitionist side, and to Miranda deciding to explore the possibilities.  Ross is so respectful of Miranda as he tries to help guide her and ease her into different fun, public situations.  Miranda is so adoring in her desire to fulfill Ross's fantasies, and it leads to her finding a new side to herself as well as Ross.  This story is a little different because, the others seemed to be mostly about the man having the most control in any given situation, but this one is more give and take.  They push, challenge, and encourage each other.  It's really cute because he may push her limits, but she pushes his buttons and threatens his sanity, driving crazy.  It's also different because rather than spanning just the one outing, this story spans days, as the original couple continues to inspire them without ever needing to be seen again.IN THE OPEN is the final story by Jami Davenport.  In her first one, she introduces two couples, but only follows the one.  This follows the other, returning to the moment they're all caught up in the couple giving the poor park bench a work out.  It refers to a little more kink by bringing up plans of handcuffs and blindfolds, and the sex is a little rougher.  Jaid and Alex face two major conflicts, his reputation as a player and her being ten years older than him.  In the end, both struggles are the last thing on their minds.  This is also the most blatantly exhibitionist story in the book.  Yeah, they've all enjoyed an audience to some extent, but here our stars actually invite an audience and put on show.  That being said, it's also quite possibly one of the most emotional - the ending almost had me in tears!The bottom line about the book as a whole is that it's absolutely hot, completely sensual, and oh so very sweet - the authors deserve a pat on the back.  In its entirety, it was an utterly enjoyable read, and I will never walk through a park, or a mall parking lot for the matter, without wondering what I'm not seeing.  After all, who hasn't longed to be even a little bit of an exhibitionist or a voyeur (or both)? *wink***I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.**","08 16, 2012",A1TU1FRPVRWXFE,Hillary,"Fun, sexy read!",1345075200,0.0,False,5.0

She reaches into our hearts and challenges us gently, yet firmly enough to waken us to our God-given servanthood.There are two primary women in this story.  One is Diana Kensington, a woman grieving the sudden death of her husband of many years.  She is a teacher at a private Christian school, even though her faith has been shaken, she hasn8217t eaten a full meal since her husband8217s death, and she sees little in her future.The second we are introduced to is a student who is brought to the school and scheduled into Diana8217s home room and final period classes.  Scottlyn Rich is obviously pregnant, which is outside of all the policies of the school.  Scottlyn also has no knowledge of Christianity or our Savior, so this private Christian school would be a unique experience even if it weren8217t a private school.  The only thing Diana sees when Scottlyn is delivered to her classroom, however, is a pregnant teen is her own judgment outweighing God8217s mercy.  She is determined to do all she can to care for her unborn daughter, Mercie, whatever the cost to her.I absolutely highly recommend this to anyone in Christian service 8211 each one of us!  Also for young adults, and those young ladies who find themselves in the challenges of teen pregnancy 8211 no matter how the pregnancy came to be.  There are spiritual lessons to be had, perhaps a different one for each reader.  For Mercie8217s Sake reflects a bright and shining light of our Lord8217s love and provision, and encourages each of us to bloom where the Lord plants us 8211 for His mercy8217s sake.

We saw how they met and a bit of what attracted Vivian to George, but I would have liked more of the story including how they got married and Vivian becoming pregnant.~I felt there needed to be more exploration of Vivian's relationship with Alex (her brother) and more detail of their relationship growing up.

Most people seem to have loved Tyler from the get go and I've been determined to stay away from that. Especially when it comes to the whole shipping Tyler and Vaughan thing. I mean, why must we have to pair people up and make couples out of everyone??? This is like a running theme in every book! Readers are always begging for every character to find a life partner and they always grasp for that life partner to be the first single girl/guy that comes into view. And in this case Tyler is the girl who comes onto the scene and poor Vaughan is probably gonna be matched with her some day just because she was the closest available option. Grrr. Can't we just wait and see if there are other options out there people?But despite my obvious dislike for a Tyler/Vaughan relationship in the future and despite my irritation with Tyler's grating personality (I mean, did you see her in the last episode? She was impossible!), I couldn't help but start to actually, kinda, maybe like Tyler in the episode. Ah!I know! I'm horrible! How could I change my opinion of her so quickly when I was so determined to dislike her for eternity? Rachel happened. That's what. She totally wrote a story and actually made Tyler a kinda likable person, even with her irritating personality still floating around in my face. Humph!And yes I did like this episode. Awesome zombie carnage just the way I like it. If I could title the episode I'd call it Fighting for weapons when you have no weapons, because that was exactly the plot was. Sounds riveting, doesn't it??Now I have to go yell at myself for starting to like Tyler.

When his wife and children are killed after a truck deliberately forces them off the road, Dell's grief turns into outrage when he is accused of being the one responsible for their deaths.Initially placing his trust in the justice system to set things straight, Dell quickly realizes those responsible for the deaths of his family have connections in both the police force and court he's being railroaded, and the only way he can prove his innocence is to bring down the real culprit. Not an easy task, and one with which Dell reluctantly accepts his father's help. Ironically, his father, Bobby Goodbread, was himself only recently released from prison, where he was serving time for his involvement with death squads under the apartheid government. Fortunately Goodbread is still connected to his old network, because the man he and Dell are after is big game.Inja Mazibuko is both a corrupt police officer and a Zulu Chief. He also happens to be suffering from full-blown AIDS, a situation he intends to cure with a traditional remedy marrying a young virgin. His intended, 16-year-old Sunday, wants nothing to do with the warlord but has little choice. Her shot at salvation comes in the form of Disaster Zondi (who also appeared in Smith's Mixed Blood), a former police officer who returns home in order to lay the demons of his criminal youth to rest. When Zondi inadvertently receives an invitation to the wedding he realizes he may actually know Sunday, and that under no circumstances can she be allowed to marry the vicious Mazibuko.Author Roger Smith weaves the threads of these five individuals' lives into an intense, evocative, and ultimately stark tapestry. Though most are familiar with South Africa's apartheid past and its fall, few are probably aware of the current state of the country. Smith very adeptly uses the plights of the individual characters as embodiments of the challenges facing the country itself. The struggle for justice and redemption that Dell, Goodbread, and Zondi are wrestling with serves as a mirror for the country's struggle to find the same, while Mazibuko and Sunday are reflections of the dichotomy of the Zulu culture one foot planted firmly in the past, the other striding toward a new, more enlightened future.It's not often something so bleak can also be beautiful, but Smith paints such a vivid, realistic picture of the characters and their hopes and motivations that one can't help but appreciate and be overwhelmed by the desire for happiness they - and the country - are all striving to reach in their own ways. Smith's writing is a master class in how to create a novel that speaks to the reader on multiple levels, as well as how to infuse a work with a message without beating the reader over the head with it.

Wannabe actresses are often depicted as dim-witted and naive, unequipped for survival. Lacey proves otherwise. When L.A. is invaded by gigantic alien cockroaches, she goes to war, quoting Lao Tzu and Machiavelli, improvising weapons based on in-depth knowledge of entomology and pest control methods (dad was in the business).Strange things happen in this book and, inasmuch as it is only volume 1 of a series, they only go from normal to bad to worse no happy ending.At first, I thought it was intended as humorous, misled, in part by this description of a chick who enters Lacey's bar (a man magnet, stick-thin, long straight thick blonde hair, probably enhanced by extensions, big silicone tatas, and large blue vacuous eyes), visits the restroom, and is disemboweled by an unseen monster. What I took as dark humor was actually only the beginning of big bug trouble in L.A.The plot unfolds as Lacey experiences signs of unruly nature (meteors, earthquakes, thunder), weird local events (spooky noises, bad odors, plumbing problems, black mists), odd sightings (space ships, large insects), news reports of large bugs and warnings to avoid.She eventually experiences the effects of alien invasion first-hand, moving through a landscape filled with human corpses, hiding, escaping, and taking up arms against the onslaught. Toward the end, she kills a bug, fashions a disguise from bug remains, visits the bug lair, moves among the invaders, and hitches a ride on one of their craft.What happens next? In the final chapter, the story is left unresolved, though Lacey states her determination to pursue the foe by saying, I was Lacey and my business was pest control.Was I supposed to laugh?","10 15, 2013",A2ZMWTHONRIW1I,O.

He showed such potential to be everything Cara needed and then because he couldn't just be honest about his past, their world crumbles.When I started reading Enlightened I was taken by surprise. In most sequels, the characters fall right back into each other's arms within days and sometimes within hours but, Cara, stood her ground and began moving on. I loved that Jason didn't force his way back in to her life, he simply stayed in the background and waited.  He would send her sweet little texts and gifts just to remind her that he was there and that he still loved her.Things seem to be going good for Cara, new look, new job, great friends but, she has a hallow feeling her that only Jason can fill. She knows that he never intended to lie to her but, how can she trust him to be honest with her? She learns very quickly that Jason Bradley is everywhere, he has left his mark on just about everything she runs into. Her job is no exception. The question that constantly ran through my head while reading this, Why does everyone blame Jason for their mistakes? I started to feel bad for him, he may be tainted by his past but, he doesn't deserve the world of grief people throw at him.With the help of Cara's friends and of course Jason changing to prove to Cara he is worth it, Cara gives in to being with Jason. I really liked Mila, Ryan, Hunter and Chelsea. They showed Cara that things are not always what they seem and even though they had their own reservations about Jason, they seemed to be rooting for him.Things aren't all pretty and perfect for Jason and Cara, there are still the people from Jason's past that rear their ugly heads, trying to drive a wedge into their relationship. There are many unexpected things that happen, that I'm not going to ruin for you. Stacy, the apparent baby mama, is a piece of work and I was literally clapping when Cara got her two cents in with that girl.Jason won my heart in this book.

It8217s clean and precise and a joy to read.  This book is no different.  I marveled more than once how smoothly the story flows and how easily Brigham describes simple little things in a very meaningful way.  Here is one example:8220Stephen had carried both of their suit jackets over his arm, so as not wrinkle them, and when he carefully laid them on the tan leather backseat of his Mercedes, Russ felt a funny lurch in his stomach he couldn8217t quite identify.8221Nice twist on the 8220I saw my toothbrush next to his..8221 analogy that has been done a thousand times too many, huh?  I loved the visual I had of Stephen being so careful and Russ seeing their jackets lying together and having it trigger something inside him.I personally love May/December romances because my husband is quite a bit older than I am.  It8217s not always an easy dynamic, either in real life or on the written page.  I have truly only read one other book (Years by Lavyrle Spencer, a M/F story) that did it well - without the older man coming off as a father figure, which totally turns me off.  I8217ve never read a M/M story with more than a ten-year age difference.  There are twenty-some years between Russ and Stephen and Brigham not only pulled it off, she nailed it.It8217s not love at first sight, but the chemistry between Russ and Stephen is instant and believable.  When Russ is injured in a fall caused by Stephen8217s spilled coffee, Russ8217s annoyance and Stephen8217s guilt and eagerness to help in every way possible is completely realistic.  Russ really has no choice but to accept Stephen8217s offers of assistance and before long, things begin to sizzle.  Because of Russ8217s injuries they are kept from acting on their attraction physically.  This forced abstinence is as sexually charged for the reader as it is for Stephen and Russ.

Her only wish is to survive and progress until she finds total silence. Whilst on a routine mission she is captured by Boone as he believes he needs a Paladin to get him onto the planet where his sister is being held captive.The bulk of this story is about the journey they take and how it changes them. Boone is a giant of a man and yet is such a compassionate individual that K is constantly thrown off balance. K has had a life lacking in comfort and as she's used to being encased in a suit that pumps her full of drugs to suddenly be without it is shocking. She has been taught that any skin to skin contact would contaminate her and yet her body cries out for sensation. Knowing that K is just a means to rescuing his sister Boone is finding difficult not to want to protect her. As for K she begins to realise that the Purist way may not always be right.This is a lovely story set in a sci fi world that tries to imagine what it could be like years from now. Earth as we know it no longer exists and humans have been forced out into space and adapted as they can. This is essentially a romance although I felt it was a sensuous read and not hard core erotica that might put some readers off. It was really nice just to drift away into the world that the author has created and I look forward to reading more from her.Definitely recommended,"09 18, 2013",AB6NBZL1IRNX,Marta Cox marta,Amazing world,1379462400,0.0,False,5.0

While the story is well written, character development is a bit lacking (which is often the case with stories as short as this one.)  Jillian is one determined heroine.  When her father betroths her to man old enough to be her father, she stows away on Vane's ship.  Jillian's plan is to convince Vane to play knight in shining armor and rescue her from her unpalatable fate.  Vane, however, is not so willing to simply throw away his freedom.  Jillian has to dig into her bag of tricks in order to convince Vane she'll make him the perfect wife.Although the story is pretty good, I really wish we were given more background information about Vane and Jillian's relationship.  We are told that they've known each other for three years, and it's pretty obvious they have both harbored some feelings for one another...Jillian more so than Vane it seems.  However, the background information we are given is more hint than anything else.

Probably Cory with his futuristic imagination knew his books would survive the myriad permutations of the publishing world. For those who may not remember, Desmond Cory is a pseudonym used by British mystery/thriller writer Shaun Lloyd McCarthy (Lancing, Sussex, February 16, 1928 - January 2001) - a writer whose novels were overshadowed by Ian Fleming's mega-success with the 007 series, but whose main character Johnny Fedora predated James Bond and to many the public came to expect even more from Cory's colorful action, copious carnage, elaborate intrigue, frequent surprises: for many the Fedora plots were more complex and intellectual. As one critic stated, `I must say that I find Cory's Johnny Fedora a much more persuasive violent, sexy and lucky agent than James Bond.'ON THE GULF is possible one of Cory's finest novels, not depending on the personas such as Johnny Fedora or Professor John Dobie to  attract the reader to a familiar style. This novel, set in a fictional Gulf state of Fariq (based in the Middle East where Cory lived for a number of years): despite the fact that the novel is some years old now since its writing, the locale and the atmosphere and  the political and cultural aspects of the themes Cory paints are surprisingly timely, given the current bellicose situation in the Middle East at present. Yes, the expected Cory tension and intrigue and embellishments into sensual situations are present, but in this mature novel  the focus is not just on action, but also on psychological insight into the characters. It is a blisteringly fine read and feels like the matrix of a very successful film adaptation. Highly recommended.

There is a fine line between Love and Hate and let me tell you that between Madison and Rick that line truly revolves around them, never have I read two characters who not only want to kill the hell out of each but also want to protect them, cherish them and finally love them.  But the beauty of it all they make it look freaking amazing the back and forth and let me tell you that with all name calling, pissing contest on who is in control of the other that this sort of foreplay is scortching.In other words Rick has finally seen the light that as much as he cared for Daniela he realized that he is not the kind of man for her and she is not the type of woman that he needs and wants.  After all his schooling with Madison the realization hit him harder than he knew, that he needed someone to wants and accepts him as he is truly is with no what if's,and's or but's about it, and all this time she was there standing beside him helping him get the girl of his suppose dreams.  I can honestly tell you that Rick has done a whole 360 here, yes he is still the arrogant man we met in The Do Over however, he steps up to the plate big time.  And he is relentless in his pursuit of everything and anything having to do with Madison Stuart.Madison is troubled by her past as strong willed as she is, she still is a broken inside from a long ago love, her parents distaste for her, and dealing with the b.s. of her brother and his side kick.  Her past is as tarinshed as an old penny but the amazing part of it all is that Rick doesn't care one bit (again he has truly come around).And just in the nick of time cause Madison will have her wilk tested and she will need strong hands to help catch her.The chemistry, loathing and mutal love and  respect that both characters have for each may not be for everyone but for them it works. The madness of loving someone is worth it.","01 30, 2014",A1EOFNV23D0GV2,janette ramos,MIAMI HAS GOTTEN HOTTER SINCE RIC GOT HIS GROVE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1391040000,0.0,False,5.0

I have very mix feelings about this book but I can't ignore the fact that I was pulled into the story within the first 2 chapters.  I guess I will try to do this without giving to many spoilers as it is a shorter book.Evie, I loved Evie. She was fascinating to me. I love how she had a strong confident side throughout most of the book. We did get to see some of her insecurities but it was more because she was in love with her best friend Jay, who happened to be dating her roommate, Cynthia. We see her struggle with the decision on what to do about it.Jay's character was also well written. He is a football player up for the Heisman trophy so I expected him to get cocky and be a total player, but he was the complete opposite from what I expected, which is a nice change. Sure he had a moment or two but who doesn't, right? I hope when the next two books come out we find out more about Jay's background. I wanted to know more about him, about his background and family life. How he met Evie and so forth.Cynthia, Evie's roommate and friend. I am not sure how I felt about her.  She was written well for her part in the story line but she was so whiny and insecure. I couldn't get a feel for her because I want to know why she is the way she is. Again not trying to spoil anything but she is the way she is because something terrible happened to her, at least that is what I am led to believe but I have no idea what it was.Then enter Pipe, he was a great edition to the story. He is the gay best friend to Evie and Jay. He definitely helped the story along and he helped give insight into Evie's background with Jay but not much. It was a nice character add by the author.Now, I am not sure how I feel about the ending. I almost feel like I needed more explanation on her choice at the end. It was almost out of character for her to give in so easily when she warred with herself for days over it.  I also didn't like the wishy-washiness of Jay and deciding on his feelings.  This is also why it seemed out of sorts when Evie made her decision about things. It was like she became weaker towards the end, not the strong girl we were introduced to. It may have something to do in the future books of this series but I guess I will have to wait and see!I also want to warn readers that there is a bit of voyeurism and non-traditional relationships in this book, so if that's not your cup of tea, you might want to think about this purchase before you make it. I have an open mind and will read anything but for those uncomfortable with it, just caution yourself if you pick this up.With that said, again, I quite enjoyed the book and read it in one sitting.

Unfortunately the great president was assassinated and suddenly the people acquired a new president to take his place.  It didn't take long before the people realized this president didn't have the same ideals as their past leader and the country would have a difficult time in trying to heal.Ginny Dye is a great historian and story teller.  I love her characters in this book. I feel like a part of their family and want them to thrive and achieve their goals of reconstructing their lives and help the freedmen and people of the south that were defeated after the war.  I have learned how people must have felt going through the hard times of despair and pain, mentally, as well as physically.  This is a story of people, men and women, black and white, northerners and southerners.  This was a time when freedmen wanted their rights and women wanted to vote and the haters of course making this virtually impossible.

The real us.Aubree Walker has a secret. A huge secret. It is for this reason that she's been avoiding her home town and everyone in it for nine months. Once high school was over, she all but fled town to a college in the city.But escaping your past isn't always possible...Aubree gets a phone call in the middle of the night--her aunt, her guardian, took a fall down the stairs in her home and is now in a coma. Aubree wastes no time. She hops in her car and heads home.Upon her arrival she's ambushed in the darkness and rain. She doesn't see a face, but it's obvious someone is out to get her.Enter Booker Outlaw. Bad boy. Town pariah. In love with Aubree since high school.Booker rushes in to save the day, but seeing him brings Aubree nothing but awful memories she only wants to forget.But someone won't let either of them forget what they did last summer.- - -Alright, where to begin? This is one of the best New Adult reads I've devoured in months! They all sort of seem the same to me at this point. With sooooo many of them out there competing for ratings and reviews you've got to bring something unique, something different, something new. I feel Zoe Dawson did this. Is there steamy romance? Yes. Is there angst? Yes. Is there pages and pages of sexual tension? Sure enough. But this book is more than just that. It's more than just a story of a damaged girl waiting around for a man to save her from herself or someone else.Aubree Walker is far from a damsel in distress. She was in such a position once before and refuses to let it happen again. It had dire consequences. So she throws herself into her college education. She's super smart and enjoys leading a plain, calm life at school. When she gets the call about her aunt being in a coma she is devastated. As a child Aubree watched her junkie mother die right before her eyes. With no father in the picture, Aubree's aunt steps in. She takes Aubree in as her own and couldn't have been a more amazing, loving parental figure. So it's a no-brainer for Aubree to go back home regardless of her fears. She's a strong, determined woman.Let me tell you ladies (and maybe gentlemen!) something. A Perfect Mess has triplets. TRIPLETS. Tall, dark, sexy-beyond-words, bad boy triplets! Boone, Braxton, and Booker. *fans self* The Outlaw triplets are the best part of this story. Each of them has something unique about them. Booker is a wealthy author working behind a pen name. This guy has been in love with Aubree since high school, and maybe even before that. When she shows up in town after leaving nine months ago without even a goodbye, Booker is torn between being angry and ecstatic at her return. The two of them share a secret that could be their undoing.The book is told from their duel first-person perspectives, which I absolutely LOVED.I always enjoy reading from a male POV. I think Zoe Dawson embodied the male mind quite well. Booker is all kinds of messed up because of Aubree. As he says many times, she just gets to him. Their romance is tentative at first, but as with most New Adult couples, the lust overtakes both of them. And this is when the 1 thing I loved about this book happens.Not only do they have sex, which I don't feel is a spoiler because it's completely expected from any book in this genre, but it's done through Booker's POV. This was not something I expected AT ALL, but I freaking loved it! You almost always see this from the woman's POV and it's always the same ol' spiel. I won't break it down, because we all know it. Zoe Dawson, for whatever reason, decided to do it through Booker's eyes. It was amazing! One of the best love-making scenes I've ever read. It made my face heat-up and my heart beat double-time. It was very memorable and will probably ruin every other NA book for me for life. :)Another unique thing about this book is the mystery aspect. What is the secret? We can guess, and there are hints, but the truth doesn't come out 'til later on. I think Zoe Dawson did a great job with the mystery.This is where I am going to come in with my negative points.I am going to try and tell you what I think without directly giving you a spoiler, but please be warned that what I say may make it easier to guess! SO, POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!Alright. Aubree and Booker aren't the only ones with a secret. Aubree's aunt has a secret as well, and it's huge. It was when this secret came out that I got sort of confused.This secret is so big and unbelievable that I feel anyone would question it and have doubts. Not Aubree. She accepts it without batting an eyelash. She barely even asks a question! I mean, I just don't understand. I also don't really feel like this particular element of the story had a point. It wasn't something that needed to be there. I feel like it crowded the storyline made it sort of messy, I guess.But it really pales next to how great the rest of the book is. :) The characters are memorable and their personalities so strong.So with that being said... Overall, I loved A Perfect Mess! It surprised me and it was one of the most engrossing reads I've had the pleasure of reading this year. The romance is steamy and angsty, but it's also much deeper than just that. The characters are multidimensional and very very memorable. There is also quite the element of humor in this book! I found myself laughing out loud many times. There's also the mystery, the thrill. Dawson created a great mystery and left no loose-ends. She kept me guessing and sitting right on the edge of my seat. So you've got the mystery, the romance, the secrets... There is drama and heartache. There is anger, pain, love, acceptance.I definitely recommend this book to those who enjoy New Adult romance. It's a stand-out book for me. It's also book one in a series. That means more Outlaw brothers! SWOON! 9829 So, go go go! Read it. Love it.","09 28, 2013",A2IHBYQAW5MAJN,Literary Meanderings,New Adult romance with a dash of mystery!,1380326400,1.0,True,4.0

Instead I stayed up until 3:30am that same night to finish it. I. Could. Not. Put. It. Down! Those Slater boys (yes ALL 5 of them) are sexy and funny and Bronagh and her sister Branna were hilarious and feisty. The story line seriously had me from page 1 and didn8217t let me go.Dominic and Bronagh start off with a hate-hate kind of relationship. He torments and teases her just to have an excuse to be close to her and she fights back (verbally and physically). You can just tell it8217s one of those situations where they are both fighting their attraction (definitely on Bronagh8217s part). Dominic is possessive (even way before they get together), protective, can be a prick, and sexy as all get out. Bronagh has spent the last 9 years of her life shutting everyone out except for her sister. He really gets her to come out of her shell and let people in. I absolutely loved the dynamic between them as well as the relationships she develops with his brothers. All of the characters had very unique personalities and I loved getting to know them.This book flowed really well. It felt like everything naturally progressed and it wasn8217t forced.

I really enjoyed reading this lovely novella.Pippa was a great heroine. She was determined to to things on her own terms, refusing to bow to the demands of others. She was clever, though oddly unconcerned about her reputation, and her antics brought a lot of fun to the book. I thought she was lovely.Lucas seemed like a domineering jerk at first, to be brutally honest. But, as the book went on, we see why he acted the way he did and that there was a whole lot more to him than what he showed. Underneath all that strict control, he was very sweet, protective of his loved ones, and determined to ensure his family's fortune after his father squandered it. I really liked him. He was rather adorable.The romance was lovely. Pippa and Lucas were great together. I wasn't really feeling it, though, because Pippa spent most of her time focused on defying Lucas and Lucas spent most of his time trying to keep control. But, I thought it was sweet that, despite all that, their feelings for each other still grew. Not to mention the sizzling chemistry between them. Overall, I thought they were a wonderful couple.The plot was well paced and I was kept interested the entire way through.

497854,B00CE4A8UM,"[1, 1]",4,"I am a huge fan of Evangeline Anderson's and there is not much I have read by her that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. Having said that I must be honest and admit that the first book in this new series Crimson Debt was not among them. I am not a lover of romance stories being told in first person with only one of the main characters telling the story. I knew going in that this series of hers was written that way but I figured I would give it a shot anyway. In Crimson Debt the female lead, Addison, is the first person point of view throughout. I might have been able to handle that except I found her character very unlikable, even going so far as to say she was a heroine that was TSTL (too stupid too live) at several points throughout the book. Sorry, Evangeline but I had to agree with the few people who gave that book a lower star review. I found very little to redeem her in my eyes and because I didn't know what Corbin was thinking at any time in the novel I just never got why he even fell in love with her in the first place.Why am I even bringing up that book or did I even consider reading the sequel Scarlet Heat do you ask? Simply because I really wanted to find out what happened to Victor and Taylor and I was willing to give this series another chance. I am so glad that I did because everything I disliked about the first book Evangeline fixed in the second. Though the story is still told in first person point of view, she alternates sections between both of the main love interests. Being able to know what was going on in Victor's head as well as Taylor's was so much more enjoyable to read. Even Addison didn't seem as obnoxious in the scenes she was in.Victor and Taylor's story was told beautifully and you really felt for both characters. Even though much of the book was based on misunderstandings that could have been easily avoided if the characters just talked to each other, it really worked for this story. Some of Evangeline's best writing is done with characters that have been horribly abused, both physically and mentally and this one is no different.So if you read Crimson Debt' and felt like I did about it, I am hoping this review will convince you to give Scarlet Heat a try because I really don't think you would be disappointed. I am also interested in the third book in this series coming soon Ruby Shadows. I am curious to see how Evangeline manages to redeem a demon like Laish. Plus I can't figure out if Shadowlock is going to be the villain or if Evangeline might be making the next book a menage. You never know with her!While the Brides of the Kindred is still my all-time favorite m/f series by her, this series has definitely piqued my interest now.

When all of a sudden your laying in bed reading it and you have to look around and see if your husband or boyfriend is looking at you. Because the look you have on your face is a really big smirk and your face is red from reading all the sexual innudendo. If you haven't read this series. You must start at number 1 and read all the way to the third one. Because in this book they mention characters that you read about in the first or second one. The third book is about Alana Gore.She is a publicist to the famous sports athletes and famous political people. Well one day Alana kept on getting death threats and she started to get really nervous about what could happen to her. So she decides to get a body guard to help protect her until she finds out who is sending her letters and leaving clues about wanting to get even with her or to kill her. She hires Chandler. He is a hot guy that owns his own bodyguard company. Well his brothers really don't care for her because of what she put them through. You will read that in the first and second book to this series. Well the tension between these two are so strong it's hard to cut it with a knife. You will be reading along and you can't believe what some of these characters have said because you only think it.

506164,B00CJBOL5I,"[3, 3]",5,"A white-knuckle action/thriller that reminded me of Alistair MacLean's finest, Dangerous Games: A Jake Collins Novel by Paul A. Rice (@RiceAuthor) picks up right after the events at the end of Tears in Tripoli (see my review) as former-Special Forces soldier-turned-security-consultant Jake Collins recognizes an extremely dangerous -- and thought to be dead -- international terrorist in a New York airport.Old dogs don't forget their tricks, so Jake follows this terrorist and in the process stumbles into a situation that he'll need all the years of training and experience acquired working and fighting in some of the world's worst hellholes to get out of. The stakes aren't just his life but more importantly the lives of all the people in his life Jake holds dear.I greatly enjoyed getting to know Jake in Tears in Tripoli, but must say from the onset that in Dangerous Games we're getting to see a somewhat different side of our narrator-protagonist. His steely determination and quick thinking are again on display but here he's under enormous pressure, back in post-revolution Tripoli and forced to suppress his emotions while desperately searching for any sliver of a chance to turn the tables. There is really no way to say much more without spoiling the fun for future readers.In my early teens I stumbled across a paperback copy of Alistair MacLean's The Guns of Navarone in my school's library from the first paragraph I was hooked and in short order I began to read everything of MacLean's that I could get my hands on. Explosive action, a steady undercurrent of tension, and steely-eyed men placed in impossible situations by forces beyond their control -- these are hallmarks of MacLean's early masterpieces, and readers will find those same attributes in Dangerous Games as well.A note on the final chapter: I don't usually read other reviews before preparing my own, but I glanced at one for this book in which the reviewer stated the final pages were totally unnecessary. If looking at just the main plot of Dangerous Games, I don't disagree the book could conclude with the penultimate chapter -- that's probably where Hollywood would roll the credits, too.However, as someone who became invested in this character called Jake Collins over the course of two gritty and tense novels, I was glad to spend that final chapter with him. In fact, I'd be happy to spend more time with Jake in the future.","08 6, 2013",A1UP17Q8BUIHU4,Scott Whitmore,White knuckle action/thriller,1375747200,1.0,True,5.0

I remain in awe of the environment that the author has created within which the characters live.Of all that these book give to the readers, my most favorite is the HOPE in the human condition that can be summarized in the following quote from The Fey herself.  I have to set the stage somewhat.  The Fey and her team specialize in rescuing hostages - WORLDWIDE.  Research and captive interviews show that THE most important thing that keeps hostages alive during captivity is HOPE in rescue.  Here is how The Fey creates that HOPE:I will come to get you, she said in his ear.  Anywhere, any time.  It's my job to show that to the men.  Not to play it safe.  Not to be safe.  But to prove to every service member that no matter what hole, bayou, jungle, frosty plain, or sand trap they are lost in, I will come for them.  That belief has saved a lot of lives.WOW - love, love, LOVE it!

The romance between the two main characters was intense, sexy, and believable, and I enjoyed their struggle as professionals, trying to deal with their attraction in the workplace, and doing so with great integrity.  There were some plot twists I didn't see coming, which I love in a romance, because after you've read a certain number, you think you've seen everything. But there was just something fresh and different about this story, and Kathryn's Shay's writing style.

The Estate is exactly what it claims to be graphic erotica with an M/M/F meacutenage that will delight fans of the genre as Grayson is introduced to The Estate. Although we don8217t get the full details, we are given enough to know that Grayson is in need of some serious relief of sexual tension. Not only that, he is dealing with his attraction to his bi-sexual boss, Marc, who has been harboring feelings for Grayson for a decade. Marc convinces Grayson to accompany him to The Estate, where Boston8217s elite shed their public persona and indulge in whatever hedonistic activities strike their fancy.Marc is one of The Estate8217s elite members. He has been waiting for the opportunity to initiate Grayson into his world, even if only for the weekend. He learns upon their arrival that Ice (the ladies all use fake names) is there for the weekend and has requested the company of two men. As Marc has indulged in Ice before and is aware of her proclivities, he is pleased for the opportunity her presence provides.Once Grayson recovers from his shock of who Ice is when she8217s not at The Estate, things heat up quickly as this trio indulge in as many pleasures as they can with one another.

As soon as you open the book, prepare to surrender your panties to Sawyer. He8217s the perfect package. He8217s walking sex, his inner monologue is hilarious, he knows what girls like, and his best side is the inside. Cheesy, I know. But, he has the biggest heart behind all that tattooed, pierced, muscle-y hotness. He is loyal, caring, knows exactly what to say, and goes above and beyond for the people he cares about. What8217s not to love about him?8220Because from the day I first saw you until the day I saw you again, I didn8217t like where I was. Now you8217re here and I do. So it stands to reason that staying with you, wherever it is we8217re going, is my best course.8221I can8217t say much about the plot without spoiling anything, so here8217s a vague outline. In the prologue, we are reminded that Sawyer saw Emmett at Parker8217s bachelor party. She was a terrible stripper, and Sawyer is immediately drawn to her. Unfortunately, they were unable to talk that night and Sawyer has no way of tracing her. Fast forward to see Sawyer banging his pain. He goes through countless girls to try to erase the emptiness he feels inside. He can8217t stop thinking about the girl who got away.8220I have no idea why it takes some couples years to fall in love and some only a day, or if any of them even know. But I do know that I like you, so much. I want to know you, and I think you want the same thing.8221They finally meet again, at one of Sawyer8217s not-so-finest moments. It8217s pretty funny. And pretty soon, she gets a job at the K, the Club Dane owns and Sawyer manages. But, it8217s not smooth sailing from there. It might have been love at first sight for Sawyer, however, Emmett has her secrets. The sexual tension builds as Emmett tries to resist Sawyer despite their obvious chemistry. I loved the build-up, but even more I loved watching them let go of their inner demons and slowly fall in love with each other.8220I told you. I warned you, Sawyer, don8217t give me your heart.82218220I know you did, and I8217m not pressuring you, but some things you can8217t call the shots on. I8217m not sure if I gave you my heart or if you stole it, but either way, I don8217t want it back.8221I felt like the plot line for Entice was a lot heavier and even more emotional than its predessors in the Evolve series. I think it might just be that S.E. Hall8217s writing is getting even better. I don8217t remember laughing this much with the other books. It might be because the book switches between Sawyer and Emmett8217s POVs, and Sawyer is downright hysterical. This book put my heart through the wringer for sure. It was full of ups and downs, and the best part was that they were real-life problems. It was just too easy to empathize and fall in love with Sawyer and Emmett.8220You scare the s*** out of me beautiful Emmett, with how fast, how hard you completely mesmerized me. One day you might figure out I8217m an ass and run screaming, but I8217ll chance it. I8217ll risk anything to keep myself by your side as long as possible.8221I don8217t know if I can classify Sawyer and Emmett8217s relationship as insta-love or a friends to lovers story. But I think it8217s both, If you read Emerge and Embrace, you would know how S.E, makes her characters fall in love. She shows that there8217s some sort of inexplicable pull between the two characters, but she lets you come on the journey with them as they fall in love fast and hard. I love it.8220You don8217t need me to save you, Sawyer.82218220You8217re right. I don8217t. You already did. And I8217d love nothing more than the chance to show you what I can be.82218220You already did.82218220Oh, Em, you have no idea. There8217s so much more I want to show you.8221Sawyer makes a complete 180 in this book. It8217s unbelievable how once Emmett comes into his life, he changes from a boy to a man. He did a lot of growing up in this book. Of course there are other factors which make that possible, but those are spoilers. I definitely swooned over the things he said and did for Emmett. And, god, is he sexy. I can8217t even. All I have to say is: DJ Booth. Read it to find out what I8217m talking about. Oh, and all his nicknames for Emmett? Swoon, swoon, swoon. Freaking killed me with all those terms of endearment.8220The thought of losing him is suffocating, a sadness so bone deep I can8217t take a full breath. I don8217t even remember who I was before I let him in anymore. I don8217t think I ever want to. The only Emmett I want to be is his Emmett.8221Emmett was more of an enigma. Sawyer wears his heart on his sleeve, but Emmett is a lot more guarded. It takes a while for her to open up to Sawyer, and even when she does, she keeps thinking that she could never deserve a guy like Sawyer and that he8217ll be leaving soon. Once we learn her reason for thinking like that, it makes a lot more sense, however, all it does before that is cause more sexual tension (no complaints here). I admired Emmett8217s strength and her determination. It8217s no wonder Sawyer fell in love with her so quickly. She is just as selfless and caring as Sawyer is.8220I knew the minute I saw you that you8217d be the end of me. I was right. You8217re it. You8217re all I see. You8217re all I think about. I love you, Emmett.8221And of course, we get to catch up with the Crew. One of my favorite circles of friends. I get to see my fave, the adorable Evan, and his love, the equally adorable, Whitley. And we get to see more of caveman Dane, and the most stubborn woman alive, Laney. I loved seeing how much they8217ve grown up in the past year or so. They8217re just as close-knit and entertaining as ever. I will be sad when we eventually have to see them go.8220Thank you. Thank you for being exactly who you are and loving me exactly how you do.8220I don8217t know about all that, but I will always love you the best I know how.8221Evan will always be my favorite Evolve boy, but I know for a fact, that everyone is going to fall in love with Sawyer. We get to see him in a completely different light in this book. Who knows, maybe we8217ll get some people to convert to Team Sawyer which means less competition for me for Evan. Sawyer and Emmett are so perfect together, even when they forget it. They bring out the best in each other, and their love is the kind that changes lives. I was extremely pleased with how this book turned out, and I congratulate S.E. Hall on creating yet another story of finding yourself and falling in love.8220The only way I know how to give all I am to one person is the way I am with you. So babe, I8217m kind of a work in progress, but I8217m your work in progress. Only yours, ever, forever. I don8217t want to be away from you, Em. I don8217t want to miss another thing.8221","02 12, 2014",A17EWXEFBXHAZ3,Trish Santos,The Sawyer book I never knew I wanted...,1392163200,1.0,True,5.0

Unfortunately her future isn't looking like it's going to get any easier.Dayton and her sister Amber lost their parents at a young age. With no real family to care for them they are sent to the Abbey to live with their cold, uncaring Aunt, who also happens to be the Abbess. Thankfully for Dayton, or Day as she's frequently called, she has a true friend, Monroe. Day just does not fit in at the Abbey. She's always swearing, eating Dum Dums, talking back and just plain causing trouble. Everyone avoids her, even her sister, and she just doesn't know why. Well, she soon going to find out.Monroe comes from a Wiccan background and has always had visions. She's been having a recurrent dream involving Day and it's leaving her, and their group of friends, with a bad feeling. They want Day to leave the Abbey as soon as she can. Where would she go? She has no other family and she's still in high school, so living on her own at this time just isn't an option. And even though there's distance between her and Amber she just isn't ready to leave her. So she stays.....which is why her future just took a change for the worse.It seems that Day is half Angel, thanks to her father. She quickly finds out that Angels and Demons do exist. Just her luck, now she's bonded with a Demon and numerous other Demons want her dead! Luckily for her, she's bonded with one of the strongest Demons and has some magical friends to help her out. Unluckily for her, the bond she now shares means they feel each others pain and can both die.Will Day get out of this alive? Can she ever recover from the deep deception she experiences at the hand of her own family? Will she choose the good or bad side in the age old love triangle?

I had hoped that it would give some additional insight into one of the characters (specifically Rose). The Seeds of Wither, at 77 pages includes content from the first book Wither which I always find awkward considering the reader that is purchasing the novella has already read the novel. It also included a small excerpt from Fever, which at the time hadn8217t been released and made a little more sense. Though for me, I8217d already read it the novel and didn8217t seem worth the purchase.The new novella, 8216The First Bride8217 Short Story as titled in the contents, is about Rose. From the first page they are married with Rose a mere eleven years old. It continues to just briefly touch on their first kiss, burying their child and then focuses more on Rose8217s decline in health. Rose tells Linden that he must remarry and let it be a muse 8211 someone that will encourage him to draw again. Of the 77 pages, 13 was 8216The First Bride8217. Not much for new content if you8217ve finished the series.Included in The Seeds of Wither was also a map of the wives floor.

Maybe that's the norm, but there were like three love scenes in this book. Then the story itself was so full of crazy and unnecessary drama that the explanations at the end just fell flat. It could have been less drama with a more believable ending and it still would have been good. I was happy with the end but I just feel like it was too late to make up for the very busy body of the story. Lastly, the editing once again was horrible.

278530,B008VIJNL0,"[1, 2]",3,"The blurb led me to believe that this story would be primarily a romance. It should be noted that this is not the case. The romance between Richard and Carol takes place entirely between the lines. In fact, Richard doesn't have much page time and I wouldn't call him the main character.What this book is really about is a large Christian family living in Oregon during the western expansion. This novel and the characters within it are defined by their Christianity. As they face the ups and downs of life, they turn to prayer and scripture. Many of the characters are children (though I did struggle to nail down their ages), and the story frequently centers around the lessons they learn from their own errors and from their family, all leading to a greater understanding of the Bible.  As such, the novel relies heavily on direct quotes from scripture.  If you are looking for a story about a large loving family who regularly discuss and expand upon their Christian faith, than you will likely enjoy this novel.My issues with the book were mostly with the execution. Their are many characters and the POV switches continually. Some scenes jump from head to head to head with such rapidity and linger so briefly that I was left feeling confused and detached. The timeline is also confusing, as it jumps forward and backwards, and I was frequently unsure whether I was reading the present or a flashback/flashforward.

Then, when it's over, you actually miss them the way you would a good friend? Well, Between the Land and the Sea by Derrolyn Anderson was like that for me. I read the whole book in two sittings, and would have read it in one if I didn't have to pick my son up from the bus stop. I just didn't want to stop reading!The story is about Marina, an intelligent 16-year old who has spent her life learning from tutors or teaching herself as she traveled the world with her father, a brilliant man that develops agricultural techniques to help save starving nations. Marina never stepped foot in a real school, but now that her father is traveling to Afghanistan, he feels it's best she stay with her aunt and at least try out a normal teenage life. But life in Aptos, Ca. is far from normal. Marina feels like she's come home again the moment she steps foot in her aunt Abby's house, and soon discovers that she has more of a connection to the place than she ever thought possible. Marina discovers new friends, new love, and new beings she never thought could exist, as well as a few shocking secrets about herself.This book had so many great qualities, I don't quite know where to start. First, the plot- I've never really read mermaid fiction before, so it was completely original to me. Beyond that, it was smoothly executed throughout the pages, never moving too fast or too slow. Every detail was revealed at precisely the right time in a wavelike rhythm not unlike the titular sea.  Second- the writing was absolutely flawless, with the exception of one or two typos. Considering that I've read huge names that have more typos than this, I'd say that's some pretty excellent editing! The dialogue was natural and the descriptions (especially of the clothes) were luscious.Third, and most notable, were the characters. Every single one, from the main character Marina to the bit players like the mean girls and the surfers, were so well-drawn that they could have walked off the pages and into my living room, and I would have recognized them in an instant. Marina's aunt Evie was, as the author described her, a real life Auntie Mame, and how I wish she was my fake aunt! Cruz' passion for fashion and Megan's melodious voice came through brilliantly. Aunt Abby was sweet and gentle, Shayla a bruiser bully with an extremely well-hidden soft underside.The love story between Marina and Ethan developed slowly, which I liked. It wasn't an instant oh, I love you, I need you, I can't live without you that tends to drive me batty. It was realistic and innocent.This is the first book in  Marina's Tales, and it was mostly about a  journey of discovery. I've already started the second one, and I'll review that as well when I finish it, but so far it seems to be more about the conflict that arose from the result of this book's journey. If you enjoy YA fantasy, strong characters, and great writing, you will enjoy Between the Land and the Sea.","05 12, 2011",A1BOATOHPT7EG8,Nikki,"Stunning descriptions, clean writing, and rich characters.",1305158400,1.0,True,5.0

After dumping her latest, she heads out to Goa on an assignment, meets her ex there and tries to experiment with her sexuality that ends in a accident.At the hospital, she meets the hot doctor Vivian, to whom she is instantly attracted.  With her best friend Baani and her boyfriend Kapil, giving her instant advice, caution and the pesky thought bubble, Kay spirals into yet another adventure of love.I loved the easy lucid style of Suchi8217s language. It reminded me of one of my favourite authors, Sophie Kinsella. Done with Men has the same tempo, easy descriptions and fantastic humour that characterizes Shopoholic series and other books written by Sophie.A special mention must be made about the inconvenient truths that the 8216thought bubble8217 comes up with.

There is definitely scope here for more funny escapades, twists and turns and disasters. Would love it, if Suchi can consider writing a series of these novels.

Combine that with a holiday setting and I couldn't resist the temptation! :-DAlthough Ask Her at Christmas featured one of my favourite tropes (the best friends to lovers trope with a bit of marriage of convenience thrown in) it failed to enchant me. Christi Barth's writing was wonderful, she has a way with words to paint the perfect holiday settings -) (you'll feel as if you were watching a holiday movie with her colourful and vivid descriptions of scenes and events), but despite the holiday ambiance permeating the story and truly adding the sprinkling of snow and bough of holly on top I couldn't love the romance since I had trouble connecting with the characters and understanding their motivations. Maybe it was because the hero and heroine were both so ready to forget about their love and give up their decade-long friendship or just because the characters didn't make much sense to me.On paper everything should have been perfect: Kyle the geeky yet drop dead gorgeous IT guy who has been best friends with unassuming, bestest of all friends Caitlin, who is ready to do whatever for him, even planning the most perfect and romantic proposal so the guy she has been in love with can ask his girlfriend to marry him. This setup right there was a bit unnatural, it took me some imagination to believe that Caitlin, despite being the best friend there could be would be so ready to help Kyle woo a woman for life when it would mean her eternal unhappiness. And their motivations behind their acts just left me baffled:Kyle is marrying a woman who is more of an escort to social events than a girlfriend to impress his father, and Caitlin is giving up his best friend and her love for him because she wants to help him obtain his father's approval.I'm not going into this marriage to make googly-eyes and quote poetry. Monica and her precious hotel chain get perks if we marry, and I get my dad's respect.Neither character won my approval. Despite being a grown up Kyle seemed way too quivering under his father's judgement and besides the very few allusions to convey that Kyle found Caitlin attractive there wasn't much to show he was in love with her or was worthy of her love.Umm, because you're dating Kyle?We're not exclusive. He knows it. Kyle certainly doesn't sit home alone when I'm out of town.Well, that was true. He'd racked up his fair share of hookups.It may be naive of me but when a heroine is celibate because she loves the hero I would expect quite the same from the hero...And the potential fianceacutee was such a cardboard villainess it made me cringe. She was really awful. I understand that in a novella it would have been difficult to make her a more nuanced character but I still would have preferred to have her be a bit gray instead of the sharp black that she  and white  that Caitlin was.Pushing up into a half crouch with one hand on the table, Monica whipped out the other to encircle Caitlin's wrist. Listen carefully. You will take the job, you will leave Chicago, and you will cut Kyle out of your life.Verdict: I still love Christi Barth's writing but despite its holiday setting and the wonderful holiday ambience that permeated this story, due to the characters I couldn't understand or like much, Ask Her at Christmas wasn't such a hit with me. Also at the end, while everyone knew a HEA was mandatory I still found the proposal superfluous and rushed. Sure, the hero's declaration of love was romantic and swoon-worthy, but I find it rushed to get married after one kiss and a decade of friendship, shouldn't they try dating first?Once again Christi Barth delivers a picturesque romance with flowing writing and beautiful lines but I just couldn't understand or like the characters, so sorry Ask Her at Christmas, it's not you it's the characters.You deserve a wife who belongs to you, body and soul. You deserve a lover in your marriage bed. Someone to be there in the middle of the night to chase the demons away. Someone who fires up your blood and stirs your passion. Someone who wants you, who needs you with every cell of her body.I give Ask Her at Christmas 3.5 stars!Plot: 7/10Characters: 7/10Writing: 9/10Ending: 7/10Cover: 8/10","12 25, 2012",A1JVLHI56QJF5V,Stella (Ex Libris),A picturesque holiday romance!,1356393600,0.0,False,4.0

Both are new to the series and are just as charismatic as all the Reed Brother characters. They come to life and grab the reader's attention. They ingrain themselves into the reader's heart and leave a wonderful memory long after the story is finished. It was nice to see the Reed family make background appearances in this story. It showed how wonderful their little piece of the world is.I absolutely loved this short novella as much as the full length Reed Brothers novels.Tammy Falkner has a gift with characterization, dialogue, and story magic.I highly recommend the Reed Brother series. Finally Finding Faith can be read as a stand alone novella. Be sure not to miss this remarkable reading experience.","01 16, 2014",AHVRXG7NK4081,shellbelle,Finally Finding Faith touched the deepest depths of my heart!,1389830400,1.0,True,5.0

454302,B00BQK9C7A,"[3, 4]",5,Guardian of Werewolf Keep by Nhys Glover has to be included in my list of the most exquisitely written book I've read. This author's writing ability is exceptional and is quite elegant while delivering a work of fiction with an incredible impact.Philomena Davenport is such a highly developed character that you instantly align with her in this journey. Each character that Nhys has created plays such a vital role in drawing you further into this book with my personal favorite found in Ellen.This story is one of sensual romance found in the most unexpected of places. Not only is this a romance but it is also a story of acceptance and understanding of those unlike the remainder of the population. The descriptions and details used throughout are at such a perfect amount that I felt as if I were observing all of these events rather than reading them.Nhys Glover has definitely turned me into a huge fan of her writing. I am looking forward to the second in this series centered around Jasper's story entitled 'Imprisoned at Werewolf Keep',"04 13, 2013",A2SZG6WUHMXZ7H,mariey,Exceptionally and Exquisitely Written,1365811200,0.75,True,5.0

As a reader who reads a little bit of everything, I have somehow not picked up a historical romance in quite some time.  This book was a quick read with very likeable characters.  The romance in this novel was balanced quite nicely with one the biggest mysteries of all time.Anna is studying to be a physician much to her mother's dismay.  While Anna's mother would like her to focus on finding a husband, she has given up on the possibility of marriage and has instead focused her energy on medical school.Drew has just been released from prison after being wrongly accused of committing the crimes of Jack the Ripper.  Anna's brother, Simon, asks Drew to work as an Inspector with Scotland Yard to help solve the crimes.  Drew agrees but Simon is quickly sent away leaving Drew to try to piece things together on his own.  Drew soon starts to depend on Anna's help on the case.  Drew and Anna are drawn to each other but Drew holds back because he feels he is not suited for a proper woman such as Anna.I did note that this is book two of a series.  I am sure that the first book covered events leading up to this book but this book is quite enjoyable on its own.  The characters in this book were fantastic.  Anna was strong willed and more than willing to go against the path society felt she should take.  Drew was a flawed man but also strong.  He worked hard in this book to make himself a better man.  I loved the author incorporated Jack the Ripper into this book as well.  It made for a very interesting story.I would definitely recommend this book.  This is the first book by Robyn DeHart that I have had a chance to read.  I look forward to reading more of this author in the near future.","04 23, 2014",A2T7T20XT8CHDE,Carole's Random Life,Wonderful balance of mystery and romance,1398211200,0.0,False,4.0

A wonderful thoughtful sister but still -- Burke was going on vacation, at his sister's expense.  He had no input.  He had no idea where he was going or what to expect.  Imagine his surprise when he finds his destination is a gay resort!There is some light humor.  Burke's suitcase was planned from a female point of view and it included all new items, with price tags.  And itchy clothes.  So what Burke would have wanted to wear wasn't what his sister bought.  Classic example was green swim trunks while everyone else was in speedos or less.  The contrast was interesting.Some of names of where to eat. .. Strokes was one.  Very obvious symbolism for a gay resort and a bit off the top.  Food choices and other names were about as bad.  The resort name Cockatiel was just as bad.  Again, that's snarky humor.There were some hiccups between Staff and Burke, but no major angst simply due to page length.  They spend their vacation getting to know each other and hanging out, leaving the sexual romps until their last day.  The slow build up and taking their time to mesh was a nice change.There was more insight into Burke's character than Staff.  Obviously they hit it off and fortunately they live close enough to each other in the states, so their relationship will continue after their vacation.  It was a nice short little break, a palate cleanser of sorts, with an over the top gay beach resort.  Due to the page length the connection between the two wasn't as in depth, but there was hope things would move on at home. -- Dan's Wife","04 27, 2014",A19MXYAHMAC99A,Daniel F.

The last book in the series. /sadface Before you venture further, before you click Read More, you should know that THIS is not a standalone novel. This brings it all together. This connects the dots. This is where it ends. You need to read up on the team, which means you need to read the novels previous.This was one of those books that you dread reading. You are dying to read it because you've read the whole series and you REALLY want the book, but you dread reading it, knowing that it means the series is over.I haven't read a book in a while that handles flashbacks in a seamless fashion. As Spencer is desperately trying to keep Veronica out of the shady side of his life, we get him reminiscing about their relationship. It is an incredible juxtaposition of their relationship then and their relationship now. You see this young, tough, sex on a stick man, hellbent on keeping his Ronnie out of harm's way even if it means she hates him forever, and then you see them just a year earlier romancing one another, lusting after one another, taking the utmost care. It's really incredible and gives such insight to this alpha male who has an ooey-gooey center.The reason why you need to read the other books in the series: While this is a spinoff, Rook amp Ronin's story introduced us to THE TEAM - Ronin the face, Ford the brains, Spencer the brawn. You learn what they do, what they did, and what is currently screwing up their lives. This is what Spencer is protecting Ronnie from he doesn't want the taint to fall onto the innocent Bombshell who owns his heart.J.A. Huss has this knack for writing characters that make you as the reader REACT. You itch to bi*chslap some of them, you want to yell at some, you want to cuddle some, you want to kick them in the shins and tell them what's what. These characters POP off the page, so vividly that you are nearly ready to text them to tell them something.The action is constantly building, the mystery man will make your brow furrow, you will want to kick Spencer's shins in the very beginning for that schmuck move in the alley, but you know he has good intentions. (And he knows for sure that the road to hell is paved with good intentions and what makes him SO likable is that he's willing to sacrifice his own happiness and desires of being with Ronnie forever in order to make sure that she is healthy, safe, and happy. You have to admire that.) You'll get to the final action sequence and say, son of a gun, that sneaky jerk!I recommend this entire series. It is smart, sexy, and full of action and twists. Characters have personalities that are totally formed by their backgrounds and experiences making them multi-dimensional and realistic as you see them struggle to not be so controlling, or so protective, or to get over themselves. The action is intense, the sex between the couples is explosive, and things definitely go BOOM.Oh...and that second epilogue? Killer.

I got past that. It was the story itself that made no sense at all. I had been waiting for this book because I really enjoyed parts 12 but this one was all over the place. Nya's character was weak, confused and borderline crazy and so was her relationship with Sacario. One minute they couldn't live without each other next minute they hated each other. I mean literally one minute Sacario is choking her out and she hates him and a few seconds later they are all kissy face. Then Sacario was arrested twice and sentence to 20 yrs in prison but as soon as he felt like it he could have his cop brother Ali or his sidechick attorney Olivia get him a get out of jail free card. Then Ali all through the book lusting for his brother's wife (Nya) and getting caught in compromising position with her several times. Let's not forget about Dinero and Kym. She was stealing kilos of coke from Nero to give to her ex Twan who is not only raping her in her home she shares with Dinero but he also have her doing drugs. Dinero and Killer Cari are suppose to be so tough but both of their women are being raped in their very own homes and they are non the wiser.

A shape-shifting dragon trying to build a sanctuary disguised as a luxury casino for his dwindling race in the heart of Vegas. These are the things a decadently delightful category romance with paranormal elements is made of. If you've ever wanted to read a wickedly good paranormal romance set against the backdrop of Sin City look no further.I can admit I never quite liked Alec because I felt like he was pretty closed off but Lucy makes up for his mystery by being a heroine you can get behind. Lucy is one tough cookie in a really rotten situation. Anyone who has a sibling that's good at getting themselves into trouble and then needing rescue will really want to see if she can pull it off. But it's hard stealing from someone who you're developing feelings for and Lucy's not happy that she's stuck bailing her brother out yet again.While LUCK OF THE DRAGON is category length there's a lot of story packed in and I was really excited by the world that Scott has built for the series. The secondary characters pepper the plot with just enough face time to make you want more and the villain is dastardly enough to make escaping his grasp satisfying.This is just one of those perfect reads for a weekend in if you love a glitzy setting, intense danger, scorching love scenes, and a fated mates romance that'll leave you craving more!Notes: ARC received via publisher.","07 28, 2013",A277TO3PKKNYDH,Rhianna Walker The geek mom and book blogger...,Stop dragon your feet and buy this one!,1374969600,1.0,True,5.0

I have never been so hurt by the ending of a book, but it was worth every emotional scar it has left on my heart. This book was8230wow.Karly has pretty deep emotional and physical scars that cut deep. They were left there by her parents. Though she could never truly understand why things in her life happened as they did, she knows beyond a doubt that they are still her parents and she will always love them. But she left that girl far behind when she left Boston. She is determined to prove that her past is not an indication of her future. She is starting her life, her way. She is strong and she is determined, but she will always have this shadow of doubt surrounding her heart that those she loves the most will leave her. It has happened to everyone she loves: her parents, her first love, her second love. This girl has had enough emotional trauma to last a lifetime. This is her turn to shine and to become something great.Only one problem with that, she doesn8217t know what she is going to do now that she has moved. She hasn8217t heard back on any of the teaching positions she has applied for despite her grades and the recommendations she has received. She knows it8217s time to move on and that is what she is going to do. She moves in with her best friend Alexis after she completes her schooling and it is time to start a new life. What she doesn8217t really expect is for Alexis8217s brother and his daughter to walk into her life, changing everything.Nicholas has his own issues and his own drama and right now his world is focused solely on his little girl, Emma. So when he gets back to town and stays with his sister until his new place is ready for Emma and him, he meets her. Suddenly Nicholas is in a situation he never bargained for. There she is, Karley. She is smart, beautiful and she is amazing with Emma. But there is no way Nicholas could ever let her into his life. He had his shot at happily ever after. She walked away from him and Emma to start her life again. She didn8217t want the family, she didn8217t want the marriage. And though the two of them tried, she was just not made for it. The loss was devistating for Nicholas and there is no way he would ever put himself in that position again. Until he saw Karley.This book was full of highs and lows. Karley8217s tragic past has left scars that you just cannot fathom. Nicholas has is little girl and is perfectly content to make her life perfect. What they didn8217t expect was the attraction and pull they had to one another. The two of them had the passion and the charisma and the making of everything good. But the two of them both had a lot of fear. Neither knowing what the right thing to do was, but the attraction was there. There was a spark of electricity between the two of them.But of course, nothing can be that perfect right? What happens if Jamie, Nicholas8217s ex, walks back into the picture? Or what if Karley8217s first love shows up in town? Oh my, this book just kept me on my toes and just when I thought there was nothing else that could possibly happen to these two, I was hit upside the head with a two-by-four and my heart was shattered.This book will leaving you craving and wanting and hoping. It will leave you broken, betrayed and angry. This book will touch every emotional hot spot in your system and will keep at it until you are begging for more.

32528,B004AM59T6,"[0, 0]",4,"Actual Rating is 3.5 StarsMy Initial Reaction8230I8217ve had so many Felicity Heaton books on my TBR for such a long time, so when I saw this short holiday novella I decided it was time. I really really enjoyed it and will definitely be making my way to her other books as soon as possible.The Characters8230For a novella, the characters in Vampire for Christmas, were remarkably well developed. Shannon and Rafe both work for the Agency hunting down demons and vampires and the like. Shannon had an encounter in her past, which unfolds for us as the story progresses, that made her want vengeance. Working for the Agency just made sense. Rafe is her vampire partner. And after two years working together, he8217s in love with Shannon. If she8217s honest with herself, she loves him too. But she8217s too scared to love a vampire after what happened to her, and the big question is 8211 will she let down her defenses before it8217s too late?I enjoyed the relationship between Rafe and Shannon 8211 it felt natural and not forced at all. Felicity did a good job making me believe that these two characters had a long history that I believed, even though I didn8217t actually get to see it. That8217s so important for me, because I really don8217t go for insta-love and was thrilled that this didn8217t even feel like it. As for their background stories, they were developed well, but I really didn8217t find myself caring too much. I knew that Shannon had something bad happen to her, but I really didn8217t care if I ever found out. I guess I wasn8217t invested in the characters at that level. That was fine though, because I cared about them in their present and the back story only served to make the present a little more complicated.The Story8230Technically Vampire for Christmas has a plot besides the romance between Rafe and Shannon. Their work for the agency has them fighting some goo demon. I frequently forgot that the demon was part of the story and found it more funny than scary or something to be worried about. He flew slime at them8230 slime that seemed to be nothing more than gross. So there was never any anxiety or feelings of danger on my part. It was neat to see Shannon holding her own, to an extent, with the demon and Rafe though. I did find myself wondering how these two had survived for two years, considering the trouble they were having fighting off this laughable goo demon.The real story in Vampire for Christmas is the relationship between Shannon and Rafe. And that was very well-written and enjoyable (as I8217ve already suggested above). Felicity is very good at creating a believable relationship and sexual tension is so few pages. And when she gets to the good stuff8230 it8217s oh so good! Hot, sexy, steamy!I have to say I was a little disappointed by how small a part Christmas played in the story, since I did pick it up as a holiday read. It8217s part of the story, yes. But it could have easily been left out and the story wouldn8217t have been changed at all. So it was a backdrop of little importance and that made me a little sad. Oh well, I still enjoyed the novella.Concluding Sentiments8230Vampire for Christmas is fun, sexy paranormal romance. Don8217t expect to be thrilled by the action or thrown into the holiday spirit, since both elements are backdrops for the romance. But if you like a quick read with some great sexual tension that does pay off by the end, this is one for you!","11 29, 2013",A1MWXGYE3F1085,Berls @ Fantasy is More Fun,"Fun, sexy paranormal romance",1385683200,0.0,False,4.0

Dr. Shayla Dennison grew up hearing stories about Queen Sheba and Arabian Sultans from her grandmother.  Shayla's love of her grandmother's tales inspires her to study anthropology and become an expert in ancient fertility cults of the Middle East.  While on a dig, her assistants discover several sexually explicit statues.Shortly after the discovery of the statues, Shayla finds herself swept away into the time of the past.  She discovers she is Queen Sheba who is about to go meet her future husband.Shayla's carriban is attacked and she finds herself separated from her people and lost in the vast desert.  A handsome sultan of an oasis rescues her and takes her to the safety of his home.  While the sultan is more than willing to protect Shayla, he does not tolerate her modern ways.  Shayla must quickly learn to cope within a male dominated society.  She must also discover a way back to her people and her thrown.The struggle between Shayla and the sultan is heart warming.  I enjoyed watching their relationship change and grow.  There was a mental chemistry as well as a chemical chemistry between the two that kept the story really interesting and challenged both Shayla and the sultan.I PERSONALLY despise it when men are drawn to one woman but have sex with other women.  This is the reason the book is earning 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  This is personally something I believe is lacking in many of our alpha male heroes and would love to see improve.The ending still has me wondering, questioning and thinking about the book.  I truly hope Kallista Dane writes a sequel to this story.I highly recommend this story, especially for anyone who enjoyed Susan Donovan and Celeste Bradley's Unbound which was formerly titled A Courtesan's Guide to Getting Your Man.

When the story begins, American Caitlyn Taylor has scored a dream gig as fashion designer-in-residence for posh British socialite Sophie Harrington. Sophie is a kind and generous boss who really appreciates Caitlyn and thinks of her as a friend (Thank you to the author for not making this character a sterotypically abusive diva!) Grateful for her good fortune, Caitlyn has an all work/no play mentality. She just wants to create beautiful garments and leave all the club-hopping and man-chasing to Sophie. That is until she meets Sophie's handsome charmer of a brother, John.An incorrigible flirt and infamous womanizer, John wastes no time in putting some of his well-practiced moves on Caitlyn. Although she can't deny that there's chemistry between them, Caitlyn has no interest in being another notch on John's bedpost (Girlfriend has some serious trust issues with men thanks to her oft-married father.) John is baffled by Caitlyn's seeming indifference, but he refuses to give up, getting sneaky and tricking her into a romantic getaway with him. Can Caitlyn continue to resist John when he woos her in the City of Light? No spoilers here, but I want to commend Ms. Mercer for bringing Paris, its wonderful sights, and its beautiful ambiance to life on the page. I have now added Have a romantic picnic in the Rodin Museum's Sculpture Garden to my bucket list!A few of my favorite things about this book - 1) I loved that there was a measuring tape in the header for each new scene. It was a cute and clever reminder that the heroine was a fashion designer. 2) The author did a great job of describing the intricacies of Caitlyn's craft without being too ponderous about it. Clearly, she's well-versed on the subject of design, and it showed. 3) Sophie wasn't in that many scenes in the book, but she certainly made her presence known. The character was so effervescent and entertaining I'd love to read a sequel to Fashioning a Romance, starring Ms. Sophie! 4) I adore a good epilogue, and the one in this book was first-rate. Written from the POV of a snarky society columnist, the epilogue was more biting than the rest of the book and it was fun to see all the characters through the eyes of an outsider. There was a line in the epilogue that made me laugh so hard I choked on my Diet Coke!In summation, Fashioning a Romance is a delightful romp that I would recommend to anyone looking for an engaging, romantic read.

Heather Killough-Walden has the rare ability to transform seemingly mundane scenes into moments of pure suspense and intrigue. I was so entranced by the relationship between Jack Thane and Annabelle Drake from that very first scene that I kept reading through the night till dawns early light when I finally finished the book and it was one hell of a ride.In order to truly enjoy the book it is best to appreciate it as a work of fantasy and just enjoy the ride. Those with puritanical views that are looking for a moral lesson should probably skip this one and head somewhere else. Now in real life my views may be a little on the puritan side but I enjoy my fantasy deep and dark so this book was definitely up my alley and Heather Killough-Walden delivered in spades. Her character development is wonderful and it was a breath of fresh air to discover the flaws built into the characters instead of the usual cookie cutter characters so often viewed elsewhere.The themes in this book are mature and there is a good smattering of adult language but other than that the book is clean. Much to the consternation of some of the reviews I have read. Usually I would be one of those as I hate a tease but I never felt a loss at the lack of a full on intimate scene. The book was too enjoyable and there was plenty of substance that held my attention and the intimacy between the characters transcended anything a mere sex scene could portray.If you enjoy strong female characters, dark and dangerous men and sleek and powerful motorcycles then this book is for you.

One day, he works up the nerve to approach him and is given a card indicating what Drew's situation is - he can't speak or write, but he's not an idiot!!!This is so well written, you hardly realize only one character is speaking as you never doubt what Drew is communicating.Drew has been in a relationship before but got hurt, Travis never has had a real relationship, so they have attraction and Travis has no issue understanding Drew or communicating with him, which is a new experience for Drew since most people don't want to make an effort to communicate with him. They spend more and more time together and become more invested in each other when Travis learns he must transfer or lose his job.  Drew has set up a life where he is and does not want to start again, so they are not sure if they are done or if they can make it work and part without really settling that.An intervention from Drew's stepmother, whom Travis had never met previously, determines what their future may be, and again, these guys made me cry for what they faced and what they chose, so I would certainly recommend this book!","11 3, 2012",A2HQLMWOMHOD1R,D.

The thing is, though, when it's all said and done, they're perfect for each other. Drew and Travis are both damaged, on the outside and the in, and there's nothing more powerful, to me, than seeing a love story grow from impossible odds.Drew has aphasia and can not speak or write, and Travis is missing an eye from an accident. What might seem an improbable relationship becomes a friendship between the two men. Travis stops and visits with Drew in the evening on his way home from work if it's not raining as Drew will sit on the steps playing his guitar and watching the passersby. Travis learns quickly how to read Drew's facial expressions and hand motions. Friendship turns to lust and then to love. But what happens to their love when the bad economy hits Travis right where it hurts and he's got too much pride to accept help?I adored this short story. Drew was so amazing considering all he had lost. He'd been a published author, a man who lived by words, and now he can't communicate except with hand gestures and some laminated cards he carries. He hadn't allowed himself to become bitter or surrounded with hatred. Drew just lived the life he'd been given to the best of his ability. Travis had no concept of a relationship having never being in one. He grew up in an abusive and unloving home so didn't really know how to connect to people. Somehow fate brought these two together and, ultimately, in a relationship that would stand the test of time.Thank you, Kim, for this story of love.

493602,B00CC68QCY,"[0, 0]",4,"4.5 StarsI've been sold on author Tamara Morgan since the very first book I read by her and each time I read her I'm more and more enthralled. It's hard to even explain why I enjoy her work so much but I'll try. I like that she goes out of her way to weave stories, I love that she chooses often different occupations or hobbies for her characters, and I admire the way she makes her characters own up to their issues and shortcomings. She never gives them an out they have to figure it out and man-up to get where they want to be. The Derby Girl is no different and for that I am extremely thankful.When Jared Fine came on the scene in the first book of this series, Rebound Girl, I'll admit I really kind of hate him. Mostly for his past sins but also for his arrogant, self serving attitude. So, I really wondered if I'd enjoy his story at all because honestly I didn't think he was worthy of anyone. Can I just say that he met his match and more in Gretchen? I freakin' love, love strong and sassy heroines and that describes Gretchen in spades. I love that when Jared first met her he saw her not at her best and he was still completely and totally enamored. Yes, he was completely clueless and didn't know her from his regular morning breakfast stop (I told you he was self centered) and of course her body art intrigued him, but the fact that he wanted to protect and help her showed he too had a better side, a side most people never see. I liked that she called him on his crap and wouldn't let him get away with bad behavior. I loved that she made him see what a complete and total prick he could be to people something I really don't think he had a clue he did on a regular basis. Yes, he said he wasn't a good person and he warned her that he wasn't the hero everyone made him out to be but she saw past that and understood the complex and the many different sides there are to Jared.Honestly on paper these two seem so mismatched. He's a respected humanitarian and world renowned plastic surgeon and she's a part time barista, part time life guard, and a serial student. He's all tuxedos and country club and she's all corsets and roller derby. But in reality they are well suited and in addition their heat is off the charts. I love that they end up going at it in some interesting places because they just simply can't wait another minute. But, I hate that neither one is honest about their feeling for each other causing all kinds of issues and insecurities especially when Jared is courted for a dream job.While their relationship is at the forefront of this book, both Jared and Gretchen are dealing with family issues and Jared's partners including his ex Whitney and her new boyfriend have firmly planted themselves in the middle of their relationship further pushing Jared's buttons and filling Gretchen with all kinds of tales. I love seeing the characters from the first book and it makes me wonder what's up next for this charming and fun series.With a completely fresh plot, witty and entertaining dialog, hot sexy encounters, characters who have something to prove to themselves, and dynamic writing The Derby Girl is a must read for romance lovers and an excellent addition to an already strong series.Review copy provided for an honest review.","08 27, 2013",A3LXRIY0HE71K,Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews Guilty Pleasur...,"Fresh, witty and sexy...",1377561600,0.0,False,4.0

252938,B008FWBWRU,"[1, 2]",4,"First off, I encountered this book as I was browsing for another adventure to read after Sandra Ross'Untouched: A Murder Mystery and Erotic Love Story. I found this book by another new writer K.D. Grace. Here's what I have to say: the characters are intriguing, in spite that I wish there were more back stories about them that would have made them deeper. The plot could use a lot of foreshadowing, too. On the other hand, for a fantasy erotica, the book passes and allows more promise for this author. Of course some of the situations would have been kind of unrealistic in another genre but that's forgivable here. I like the setting, the idea about The Mount, the idea about this elite people. Again, I wish there was more foreshadowing about what they were about without making the mystery suffer, in a way that will not require too much effort for me to guess what the hell is happening now, or what are they up to next and hoping the lack of foreshadowing pays up in the end. Kind of a little helping hand as I go along. I also like that even when the scenes are a bit unrealistic, I can actually imagine them. Rita's Tango with Alex in the beginning is delicious and exciting. The author has talent in making you impulsively see what she's trying to tell. That makes up for me the lack in character development and exploration. The sex scenes make this book a wonderful erotic read. That part will not disappoint.If you're expecting too much for a book, you might set this aside for now. But if you're looking for an author to follow in the erotica genre, K.D. Grace is someone to look out for. This is the very first book that she's published and the result is admirable. I would have given her three stars as comparison to other erotica authors in general, but I gave her four in consideration of this.","09 13, 2012",ABETGU1SDYVHT,Drea M.,"As a fantastical erotica, this passes well!",1347494400,0.5,True,4.571428571428571

The strength she had, despite being a small, shy woman, as she woke up to find herself naked and chained to a cot in a strange, dark room. She didnt scream and despair, she didnt panic. She held herself together long enough to discover that there was a hidden light in the darkness.Aaron was a man lost. Lost in his own darkness. Lost in the life of crime that was forced on him by his father. You could see that he was fighting the life that he had been dealt. Like another Aaron, his father sought to corrupt him, and although he reveled in the control and violence of his position in his father's organization, he had limits. Lines he refused to cross. He wouldnt let his soul be wholly lost.Aaron has never brought a woman that he could care about into his life, knowing how he would corrupt her. Knowing how his father would use her against him. But, when Aaron shows special interest in the beautiful concert cellist Madeleine Clark, he unwillingly gives his father the tool to control and destroy him. But what his father didnt know, was that by bringing Madeleine and Aaron together, he had also given them both a reason to fight, to face down death and become lions.The writing and dialogue in this book is beautiful, but you should be warned of the darkness you will find. It is full of abuse, inhumane degradation, and violence but above all, the strength of the human spirit and enduring love. But the violence did almost overshadow the beauty of this story near the end. It is the reason for the missing half a star. I'm talking about graphic disembowelment, dismemberment, and beheadings. I knew to expect more violence for the climax of the story, but I didn't expect it to be that strong. It was much more than I would have wanted, or what I was comfortable with and it really turned me off for a few moments. But before that I was convinced it was going to be a 5-star book. I still feel like it deserves a 5-star rating rather than 4-star though.A bonus point for this book, is that the scene on the cover actually did happen.

At first glance you notice that Maddy8217s music has sheltered her and she hasn8217t really been exposed to the world.She is weak and she is a true damsel in distress. I love it.When we first meet Aaron, we find him cold, distant and basically a butt. He yells commands towards Madeleine and provides punishment when she disobeys him. But not everything is what it seems. Once you get to know Aaron and see what truly lies behind the mask of the monster you start to understand why he is the way he is.There is plenty of tension between Maddy and Aaron. This is only one of the many things that happen in the book. Many times Aaron8217s father comes into the picture to test Aaron8217s loyalties and those are probably one the hardest parts to read in the book.As stated, there is rape, violence and lots of graphic scenes. The author goes into detail of death, blood and the gore that comes along with it. I was not surprised by these parts. I felt like it was a necessary black cloud that was needed to make this book dark.Madeleine Abducted needed to be longer and needs a new cover. The book was too short to convey its full emotions. I would say the first half was fine, I got it, I was just glued to the pages. When we get to the shift with the second half, it was a bit rushed and as much as I enjoyed the crazy climax, it was a bit rushed. As for the cover, it does no justice for this book. It8217s a beautiful story and needs something less in your face.However, with those minor complaints aside, it8217s a beautiful story about pain, manipulation and love.If you like dark reads, love kidnappings and intense love stories, this one is for you. But I warn you, it8217s crazy.This review was written by Jacqueline's Reads - 62 jacquelinesreads.blogspot.com","02 5, 2014",A5FDYZB6MG2TT,Jacqueline's Reads,4.5 This-book-is-crazy Stars,1391558400,0.0,False,4.333333333333333

The most interesting part of the plot was the complex relationship that undercover ex-Royal Marine Sergeant Ian Mann forms with the man he is supposed to get to know and to confirm suspicions that he is part of a gang stealing livestock and farm machinery. The kinship and genuine bond that develops between these two men show a world that is not black and white, and how decent men can be forced into criminal behaviour out of desperation and necessity. The danger of Mann being exposed and his cover blown provided a real tension throughout the book.

I'm a huge fan of when relationships start off rocky at first I love back and forth sexual tension. Lexi and Kyle definitely had that charisma from the first moment they met. I thought it was a cool and original concept that he beheaded her snowman-who does that LOL. The book was told through both of their point-of-views, each rotating turns. I loved getting a sense of when the attraction started before the other character even realized.I could relate to Kyle the most-we're both 30, both bah humbug when it comes to holidays, both writers. I thought it was sad that he lost his mom on Christmas Eve and Lexi was an orphan. Through her pain of a divorce and no family except her kids, Lexi managed to help Kyle host a family get together at his home. I was touched by the scene when everyone is in his living room discussing what they miss most about the mom.I loved that even though it was clear to the readers that they both liked each other, Lexi and Kyle were both insecure about how the other person felt. It reminded me of crushing on someone in junior high. The plot thickened when Kenneth (Kyle's brother) made a move on Lexi apparently he was the ladies man.My favorite moments were whenever Lexi, her two kids, and Kyle hung out. The kids were in awe because he was a celebrity to them. Their favorite books were the Jared Strong ones.

Zoe YorkReview from Jeannie Zelos Book Reviews.Book three of the Wardham series, but as each book is a standalone and complete, it didn't matter that I hadn't read earlier ones, though possibly there were small things I missed, connections etc from not knowing the characters.Still, it was easy to pick up and follow the story. Its a sweet romance, the unexpected consequences of a hot and sexy, and for Evie, very unusual one night stand. She doesn't have any info on Liam though other than the basics, so telling him he's to be a dad is going to be hard. Luckily he turns up in the town where she lives, and he's delighted. He wants to dive in and be part of Evie's life, but after two failed relationships, and with two young sons to look after she's very cautious. Add to that he's a few years younger and ...she's running scared. Liam's a gem though, not easily put off, not going to abandon her and his child and gradually he insinuated himself into her life. I loved him, a really genuine, kind and loving man. He'd had a difficult family relationship, and wanted more for his child than he had from his upbringing. Evie, she was sweet, loved her boys but was really conscious of the slurs on her character her ex had thrown around. She knew once he met Liam she'd face taunts about his age. Its easy to say the only opinions that matter are our own, but hard in practice to make that work, and Evie was always running an internal monologue about what she should do/had done and what she ought to have done instead. It left her with little self confidence, and yet she was an excellent mum and support to her kids.Its a sweet story, lovely character,s including his and her friends, a little gentle drama, but for me it was just a bit too soft and sweet. I needed a bit more highs and lows, anger and happiness, tears and laughter. Still, as I8217m always saying that's just my view, and there are other readers that adore this kind of gentle romance. Its well written, had parts that pull at emotions at times, especially those lovely boys of hers and how they try to look after her sometimes :)At the moment is on offer at just 77p for 252 pages, so a bargain if you like this small town, gentle romance type of story.Stars: Three, a good book just not enough drama for me to rate it higher.","02 12, 2014",A1X2URS71RRMMF,Jeannie Zelos jeanie zelos book reviews,"sweet, gentle small town romance",1392163200,1.0,True,3.0

Although it commences in early 20th century England (approx. 1920) and moves to events of 1940 during the Nazi blitz of London, for me the book really got underway with the contemporary story of eighteen-year-old Christopher Ross of Golden, Colorado, a boy who finds computers and drafting simple as pie, yet with his dyslexia struggles to read. Christopher is a solitary with a special talent: tritely put, he is a human lie detector. He can read what an individual is actually thinking, while he or she is speaking something else.Lately Christopher has been mentally plagued by an entity named James, who is deceased but yet not a ghost. James is purely evil, but his mentor V is much worse. Then Christopher's life is uprighted when another Other, Ellie, appears-it is she who was born in 1920, concealed from an evil society by her uncle Edward, who was himself a seer, and died in 1940, just before her eighteenth birthday. As an Empath, she has spent her life-and afterlife-helping others. Now as she discovers Christopher, she and he both fall unwillingly in love.Author Elyse Draper has a lyrical and poetic imagination and brings the many locales to vivid reality. Her view of afterlife is also unusual, but logical (if it's appropriate to call spirit entities a logical progression). The rollercoaster ups and downs of emotions Ellie, Christopher, and the secondary characters go through is easily comprehensible, and more than one tear will be brought to readers' eyes.  Christopher certainly is in line for becoming one of the higher pantheon of young male protagonists.","09 13, 2012",A81S2CYRRJGHI,Mallory Anne-Marie Forbes Haws Fair and auth...,"Unusual, Poetic, Vivid Metaphysical",1347494400,0.0,False,4.0

Pigtastic isn't as long as My Pet Dragon, I was expecting it to have a bit more content.  Basically it's an anti depression, maybe at the result of bullying keep your chin up, think positive tale. A pig talks to the reader about when it feels down, it remembers it's pigtastic and everything is great again.  A great message for sure, but the majority of the text has the pig working out (as in exercising) and not changing, as in well that's why I'm fat, but oh well that's me there isn't anything I can do about it. This isn't going to be the case if an obese child who is being made fun of and is depressed was given opportunities and support to exercise in real life. It's just the wrong message in a world where a lot of people look for excuses or have an its not my fault attitude to various things not just being overweight, it's just the wrong message to pass on to the next generation.  It would have been a better story if the pig wasn't exercising if the point was to except everyone for how they look. Maybe the text could have focused on its big nose which the pig can't change or something like this.Again though the illustrations are brilliant which bring the book up overall in my rating.

I loved 8216Irrepressible You8217 and was looking forward to this author8217s second contemporary romance/chick lit novel. I was especially keen to see how a feisty oil-rig engineer tom-boy would be wooed by a mild mannered, marketing rain-man of a Margaret River vineyard. Once again I wasn8217t disappointed.It8217s difficult to outline the plot of 8216Unforgettable You8217 without giving away too much about both novels. It8217s enough to say that both stories explore the lives of two sisters who experienced a childhood marred by domestic violence and yet whose life-responses couldn8217t be more different from one another8217s. In Amy we find an ultra-feminine kitten with nerves of steel who8217s on an unconscious mission to avoid emotional intimacy. In Jo we find a volcanic wonder-woman on a mission to hide her inner softness and her conscious hankering to find just that. It takes the patient persistence of beta-hero good guy, Stephen Hardy, to finally break through Jo8217s brittle front.This is another great story from Ms Penney. The writing is incredibly detailed, to the point where you can imagine everything going on in the scene, and yet the story telling never sags. The characters are so vivid they leap off the page. Their stories aren8217t just told from the point of view of two protagonists looking lovingly into each other8217s eyes, it8217s told from within the dynamic network of the interwoven friendships surrounding the Blaine sisters. In some ways these books remind me of Richard Curtis8217 screen plays (Love Actually, Notting Hill etc) with the focus on a 8216family8217 of friends 8211 all successful, talented, Gen-Ys of the business and artistic worlds, and yet all of them a bit lost in their own ways, searching for something more meaningful beyond material success.8216Unforgettable You8217 tackles some very tough issues. Domestic violence and the way it affects the children involved, preventing them from realising their full potential in a myriad of ways, is not for the faint hearted amongst writers. I loved that 8216Unforgettable You8217 sensitively explored another dimension of this issue through a quite different sibling within an affected family. And I loved, of course, that the decent, deserving Stephen Hardy was the man to see through the protective smoke-screens to the real Jo Blaine.

Wise it really looked interesting and I love mysteries, paranormal and such so figured it was right up my alley. I should have read the description first but more about that later. The cover really is what sold me on getting it.I won't recap the story since you can read the author's description for yourself. Just remember this is book one of a trilogy so don't expect every question you have to be answered in this first book. This book covers the building of the story and character development for the most part. The author does a great job with the characters and I did feel a special connection with the main character, Alma. I am not sure if it is out of sorrow for what she went through as a child or if it is because now as an adult she is haunted by the not remembering what happened and needs to put it behind her so she can go on with her life. Between this and her mothers death, her father after her, and a boyfriend she loves but just can't seem to stay in a relationship with, nothing seems to be going right. I can also feel the doubt she has if she really was responsible for her brother's disappearance. It seems for the past 16 years her life has been a nightmare with all these things playing in her mind and the ever present number 314, if she can only remember what really happened.I have to admit when I was first starting to read the book I became a little frustrated with the way it was written. It kept switching back and forth from 16 years ago to present day. I have read stories where the beginning was the background of what happened a long time ago and then the story jumps to present day and continues but this was written with a little glimpse of this or that which happened 16 years ago and it almost seemed unrelated to what was going on in present day. It was like reading bits and pieces of two different stories however I stuck with it and it wasn't that long until I realized why the author wrote it this way. It was brilliant! Something I wasn't expecting and totally made sense plus I loved how it came together in the end.Now, back to why they say you shouldn't judged a book by the cover. I read at night before bed for the most part to relax me and I eventually drift off to sleep. Not so with this book and I would have realized it if I read the Warning in the author's description. This book is indeed graphic and led me to some disturbing nights of sleep which was totally my own fault. But let me explain, I often look at covers and don't read the description of books to get surprised as the story unfolds. By reading the description I often pass a book by because it really don't sound interesting to me but come to find out, it is a fantastic story. This is one of those books. Had I read the description I would have passed this book by because I am not into the real graphic stuff and I would have missed this great story. Even though it was disturbing to me the story was so good and captivating I couldn't put this book down. The reason I am mentioning it is because if you are not into graphic scenes, don't read it. It will give you nightmares. (Remember, this is the goal of the author and he succeeded with flying colors, 5 stars to you!) So with that being explained, I only recommend this book to adults who like horrors with graphic scenes.","02 10, 2014",A8JIEN57TPE94,Sue in CT,A horror that will give you nightmares!,1391990400,1.0,True,5.0

Although I read the story in one sitting, it became predictable after a while, as I already mentioned in my review about Torrent. This was a bit of a disappointment, since I started it with a lot of enthusiasm. It just didn't meet my expectations...In spite of the predictability, Lisa T. Bergren managed to show the brutality of a medieval war. No modern medicine, no hygiene. Retribution that won't even spare children. And of course the medieval men and their view about woman. That's something that I find very annoying every time I read a historical roman. But o well, what can we do about it? It's something that's normal in that time. You can't cross time and space to make them see their wrongdoingsFurthermore I liked reading through the eyes of Lia. In the other books, where Gabi is the main character, I got to know her as a very agreeable girl. The real deal is something else! When the need arises she knows what to do and how to handle those chauvinistic medieval man. Loved it! ^^I also loved reading about the blooming romance between Luca and Lia. You could see the hints between them in the first three books, but now it's their time to shine! And they are such an adorable couple! They behave much more like two teenagers in love than Marcello and GabiMy conclusion: 3 hearts. Although it was an enjoyable book that gives a clear understanding about that era, it was a bit too much of the same concept as the previous three books.

This is a short novella so I didn't really get a good feel for Nicholas's character yet but so far he comes off like an arrogant playboy who feels as though he can just take whatever he wants. While the plot feels like a few novels I've read before and is sort of predictable it is still very well done.I feel that Rebecca's character is strong enough to make this plot stand out against other similar stories. I can't say too much without giving a spoiler but the last interaction between Rebecca and Nicholas in this volume was priceless, I laughed out loud while tempted to yell you go girl. I'm excited to see how their relationship is going to develop with their white hot chemistry considering there is a huge obstacle between them. It's obvious that once they get together the sex is going to be scorching and I can't wait, I just hope Rebecca's character stays strong and true to herself!REVIEWED BY JAYMEE O'NEIL PINDAR FOR SUMMER'S BOOK BLOG","07 9, 2014",A32EUN2MXY9FHT,Summer's Book Blog,LOVED IT,1404864000,0.0,False,4.0
398067,B00AWFIJXS,"[0, 1]",5,"This book is really something different. A friend told me the hero of this story will stay with me, and she was right!I felt so much for Jason! He is such an unconventional hero. The way he dealt with the life he had to live was really admirable. There's a lot of self-hate, because really, he has no one to blame for except for himself. He couldn't shift the blame, he couldn't lash out at people. It was heartbreaking, but at the same time he is so strong. And he never embellishes what happened to him - he owns up to his own stupidity and I really respected him for it.This could have been just another in line of romance books - but Anna's character is what made it real. She's a smart woman, and she constantly questions whether or not being with Jason is a good idea - if she will be able to handle his disabilities, if they have a place in each other's lives, if they can deal with their very different lifestyles. I think it was very realistic, I know I would stop and think if I was in the same situation. It's what people do. And she has appropriate reactions to everything that happens in this book. And makes decisions that are right for her, rather than for Jason.Their relationship is strained in the beginning, neither of them knows what to do with the other - but there's awesome chemistry as well. I liked the romance so much, because it was so unique. You have this educated, ambitious woman, you know they strive to date in their social circles rather than a lowly brain damaged janitor, but the pull is just too strong between them. And the change both of them bring to each other's lives was just overwhelming.I did feel it was a bit of insta-love, though, so there.So the writing? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Reading Jason's POV, you really get that he has brain damage. His thought process, some of the things he does, the way he goes about his daily routine. I really applaud the author for this.I liked the supporting characters - grumpy Rob who turns out not to be so bad, Anna's parents who only make a short appearance but they're not horrible, they're just worried about their daughter, Jason's little sister who I absolutely loved. Just great. It's not that any of them were really important, but they all bring something good to the story.So, this is my first time reading a Bonnie Dee book, and I sort of expected things to get really steamy. There are a couple of graphic sex scenes in this book, but they're nothing you won't read in other contemporary romance.Overall, an unconventional love story with an unforgettable hero who gets a second chance at life and uses it, and a smart heroine that has her priorities set straight. Do I even have to recommend it after I said that? It was different. I really liked it.","03 20, 2013",A64B5ZZOU64IQ,Amazon Customer,Different and wonderful,1363737600,0.0,True,5.0

674598,B00FMX4F9W,"[0, 0]",4,"SAVED BY VENOM is the third book in the thrilling lti>Grabbedlt/i> series. The book comes to the lucky readers by courtesy of the talented author, Lolita Lopez. This series has been so well done. I have read and enjoyed each book so far. I am going to say that this latest book is my favorite one so far. It was exciting with some intricate subplots going on that never once let my interest wander. The story and the characters hooked me hard and fast, and swept me away into this exciting world that the author had created. It was definitely a winner for this reader.For those readers not yet familiar with it, let me fill you in on the setting for this series. The Harcos race is technologically advanced, and the premise here is that their warriors (known as Sky Warriors) are the protectors of an Earth colony called Calyx. Females are scarce on their home planet so the price for that protection happens to be human brides. Their tradition is to claim the mate in a race. Personally, I find that premise exciting. It is also to be noted that each of the books in the series have been very detailed with great character development. Even those who haven't tried the other books will find this one a breeze to read. I don't know about everyone else, but it's important to me when reading a book set in a different world that I don't get lost while trying to catch up. I hope that makes sense.As the story opens, we find the warrior Venom getting ready to grab his own mate. I had already met Venom in the last book, but wasn't sure what to expect of him here. For my own personal reasons, I found that he made the best alpha warrior of all. The woman that he chose was an interesting one. Dizzy has a bit of a past that actually comes out later in the book. It was surprising and unique. That is all I can say about that as it plays a very important role in the plot. We find Dizzy at a crossroads of sorts. She had never expected her own father to sell her into the Grab. I loved how Venom and Dizzy ended up together in the beginning. Dizzy realizes that her life would be better by going with Venom and she makes it her own choice to take his collar. More important to note is that he allows her to make the choice. Considering the BDSM tone of these books, I felt that to be a good omen for the rest of the story.I really loved both of the main characters in this book. Venom was so honorable and caring toward Dizzy right from the start. I couldn't help but fall in love with him. In the future, the author will have to work it hard to top this hero for me. That said, I loved Dizzy just as much. She was so independent, yet so calm and accepting of Venom and his culture. Not that they didn't have some drama to go through. Far from that.The plot was solid. It was put together nicely and woven with intricate subplots. Some that I am sure will play out in future books. Everything was happening for a reason. Secrets start to surface about Dizzy that threaten to take her from Venom. There is a giant elephant in the room8230waiting to jump out at the reader. The Shadow operatives are once again in the thick of things here. Ugh! Those guys get on my last nerve, but the plot would get stale without the drama they bring to the game.This book also gave a lot of insight into the Sky Warriors and their culture. It was so detailed that I can't help but think maybe the author was laying some groundwork for some future book. Or she is just that good at pulling me in and getting me intrigued with her story. Either way works for me.Now let me catch you up with the good stuff. You know, the love scenes. With this series, you get some BDSM. Venom has a thing for ropes and bondage, a bit of spanking. It was all very well done. Very caring and passionate. Be warned if that ain't your thing. Personally, I loved it!To say that I enjoyed this book would be an understatement. I absolutely loved it! It is my favorite so far. It had a lot of things happening with not one dull moment. It was intense and left some situations open for future books I'm sure, though it gave me the happy ending that I crave. Lolita Lopez definitely hit the right buttons with this one. So I am giving it four flying stars and recommending it to everyone. On a side note, I have recommended this series to my own personal friends. For me to do that means Lolita Lopez makes the cut.Reviewed by Debra Taylorfor TheRomanceReviews.com","12 1, 2013",A5JZNVV4TEAWU,Carole The Romance Reviews,I absolutely loved it!,1385856000,0.0,False,4.555555555555555

610743,B00EDDBT9G,"[3, 4]",5,"This one is really good. The idea is fresh and very well executed. I could not stop reading once I started.I really like Austin and Cam. Their day to day painful struggles with the terrible memories of their 5 months plus incarceration by a psychopath was so well portrayed and heart wrenchingly real. It was easy to understand why these two needed the other to survive the horrendous memories. Each man only have the other while they were caged together. Only Austin could understand Cameron's pain and horror and vice versa. Noone else could. So it was easy to understand how the bond they forged while they were in captive was really something so much deeper.However I do have a little niggle. I could so understand the resulting love between these two guys. However could Austin so easily embraced the sexual part of it. On the other hand I am just nit-picking here as the writer did mention in a few sentences that Austin did appreciate beautiful men as he did beautiful women. So Austin was inherently bisexual. Maybe a convenience but hey this is MM romance.. Austin's marriage which had long ceased to work and a cold wife of course also helped Austin's case.I really love the growth in Austin's character as the story progressed. Austin used to be stoic, easy to please, against changes, just a simple man who does not ask for much to be content with life. His kidnapping, terrible as it may sound,  actually helped this character to grow, to be able to say no, to want more in life and take that extra step even if it was stepping out of his comfort zone. As for Cameron, revelation about his background made us realized how much harder it must have been for this character to have emerged from the ordeal still sane, much less be there for Austin. I love how one helped the other to deal with the pain and horror. At the end of the day it was so easy to root for these two to be together.As for the plot, I could only say that the flashbacks detailing their torment at the hand of the psychopath is brilliant writing. Suspenseful, riveting,  deeply emotional, bleak, heartbreaking, at times horrifying and painful to read. Yet I could not quit reading. I found myself helding my breath in nearly all the flashback scenes. Thankfully the writer interpersed the current story with the flashbacks, the flashbacks constant but short and therefore easier to read, a writing skill I appreciate.Ok so the last 20% of the story revert to the typical MM romance but hey after so much pain and suffering Austin and Cameron certainly deserve their happiness. This one seems to be only MM romance from this writer. Very glad there is a novella in progress of another victim and this time the writer could maybe tie up some loose ends. This one certainly deserves the no. 1 position in the gay romance list. Great read.","08 18, 2013",A1ARJBC8VD5P8P,R.Parklane,At last something different! Love it.,1376784000,0.75,True,5.0

The last thing he expected was for her to overhear their discussion or for Ava to lay a lip lock on Pete and demand a date that Friday night.Ava's always been shy and worn clothes that downplay her form, but Luke's oblivious attitude calls for a serious makeover and her friend Jen is more than happy to help.

Where two worlds collide, salvage versus civilized and unique challenges arise. Axe most definitely has the creative writing gift to capture the reader's attention, paying attention to detail and ensuring the story flows through start to finish, with little time for air in between. As you'll read in the introduction, the main character telling the story is Jhinn, the Wild Elf, who expertly becomes instantaneously likeable and relatable.You can't help but become emotionally connected and this helps direct and guide you through the twists and turns of this tragic yet exciting adventure. He manages to join forces with the humans on a joint adventure of protecting his wild home, the forest. Of course I'm sure their understanding and meaning behind it all was completely opposite.Jhinn meets his soulmate during this scenario, falls immediately in love and their journey continues. Taking you through ups in downs uncivilized, mirroring those in our world today. Unfortunately it all doesn't end well but the messages gained from this uniquely empowering tail are fabulous.My advice to you is take the time to read this story through and let the author know know thoughts.

It was also not very fair to the author.  I was not able to see past the ending and judged the book solely on the ending.  I even messaged the author.  Complete honesty here )  I received less than pleasant messages in response to my review from other readers and reviewers.  After conversing with the author via Facebook, the author brought it to my attention that what I wrote her in my detailed messages about the book was vastly different then my Amazon review and THAT should have been my review.  I re-read my detailed messages about the book to the author and my Amazon review and SHE WAS SPOT ON.  I made the choice to delete my review.  I repeat...I made the choice.  I am now back to compose MY REVIEW OF THE BOOK AS A WHOLE.  Amazon has a review system that needs work.  So, I am going to go by my own.  Hang in there with me!  Here goes:1.  First a caution.  When the author gives you the warning, read it, read it again and abide by it.  She means it!  I have read many dark reads but this was by far the hardest for me to read and the darkest for ME.  If you cannot handle very graphic descriptions of torture, abuse, torment, rape, murder, etc. then this is not a book you should venture to read.  The description of the things I just mentioned were graphic and disturbing that it caused ME to be sick.2.  The characters.  The heroine, Stella, is one of the strongest heroines you will ever read about.  She has had more pain and torment than any fictional character should ever have to endure.  She is the definition of STRONG.  So many words could be used to describe her.  She grew and healed and then...well, you will have to read.  Wesley, the alpha male who did not want permanence or forever.  Strong, loving, nurturing and supportive but also inexperienced and unsure and stubborn.  Loved them both.  The MONSTER...inhumane.3.  The plot/story.  There was the relationship between the H and h, the D/s relationship, the healing and dealing with the past, the obsessed sociopath, etc.  It had twists and turns and kept you on your toes.4.  Balance.  I, personally, like a good balance of bad and good...light and dark.  It does not have to be an even split by any means.  I do not need hearts and flowers at the end.  But, I do prefer a good balance.  When there is so much dark i t is hard to see any of the light.  This had too much dark for me and not enough light.5.  Grammar.  There were errors.  There were not tons, but they were present.  At times, I had to go back and re-read the sentence.6.  Language.  I can handle profanity in my reads and I am not a prude, nor do I have a stick up my arse.  But, sometimes the language that the H, h and her friends used was bothersome.  The H and h were very intelligent.  I think the h went to Columbia if I recall.  Their language did not always match them, even in their badass moments.7.  The ending.  The ending was horrific, horrendous and sickening.  There is no sugarcoating it.  There is not a HEA.  It made me vomit several times and I had nightmares that night.  It was very hard to get past.  After the ending, that's all I saw.  That is all that stayed with me because it was so horrific.  I could no longer see the beauty that I read previously because it was overshadowed by the ending.  I thought of the ending from the POV as a heroine, mother, woman and someone's significant other.  I thought about it from Wesley's POV.  Good God!  You will root for these two throughout the book.  You want them to have love and peace.  You want healing.  But, YOU WILL NOT GET IT.  KNOW THAT.  Here is the main point of my statement again...out of all that, what replays in my thoughts is the ending and the ending only.  For me, the beauty was lost.","05 5, 2014",ASLFWJ1KUWNZI,amac,Overshadowed by ending for ME.  Alternate ending would have made this a 5* for ME.,1399248000,0.625,True,3.0

The first two books I read, I was surprised how any avid reader could have rated them with 5 stars. For this reason, I wasn't expecting this book to be any better.  When early on in the story, our hero ended up back in time, I honestly thought, Oh no, another rubbishy read.  I have since waited three days to write this review.  I needed to think about it seriously, because, as other readers have already mentioned, it opens a new concept of thought.  The reason that I found this book disturbing is because my Father had serious psychological problems.  The lives of my Mother, and I as a child, were absolute misery for years.  We endured both physical and mental torture over a period of time, which was impossible to forget.  Probably the worst part being that when my Father was on a high or good frame of mind, he was a good companion and warm person, who suddenly, for no apparent reason, turned into a person that filled us with dread.  For this reason, my sympathy has always been with families afflicted in the same manner, rather than with the patient.  My Father died eventually from a brain tumour, which nobody deserves to die of.  I had no bitterness left by then, as with maturity I realised that it was a sickness.  However, I cannot cope with people that have similar problems, and have found throughout life that the first characteristic I looked for in a friend or partner, was a rational mind.  I don't think that I would have read this book, if I had realised the content.  However, once I started it, I couldn't put it down.  Yes, I found myself routing for Simon, held by the excellent prose and description of characters and scenes. This book fills your imagination, and draws so much empathy from the reader.  Even now, I'm still confused, is mental illness caused by disturbing childhood experiences, or can these illnesses be explain clinically, as another error in our DNA.  Why are some of us so badly affected by childhood experiences, while others simply move on with their lives.  Should we medicate sufferers to protect the innocent?  If you read this book, you will be left, like me, with many questions unanswered.  Perhaps in the future more research will answer these questions for us.

The ending was obvious, what romance isn't, but the joy should be in the journey. It lacked that joy and it lacked any plausible chemistry between the two main characters.

I am a sucker for a good biker book and this one did not disappoint!!This story is told from Maddie's POV and from the start my heart broke for her. The story starts with the death of her mother and because of the life she has been forced to live (a mother addicted to drugs and has let her drug dealer basically have Maddie for his own since she was 13 and an absent father) she is not saddened by her death and feels guilty for it. She has no money and no place to go so she decides to go to her dad who is the president of the Outlaw Riders MC till she can get on her feet.Once she gets to her dads, she meets Cole who is VP of the Outlaws...SWOON!!!! Everytime Maddie is around him or thinks of him her panties get soaked!! Cole has decided he wants Maddie for his own and he will stop at nothing till he makes it happen. I love Cole and Maddie together. They have the instant connection but I love the banter that goes on between the two. Finally, Maddie gives in and decides to be Cole's Ol' lady only to go back to her dads and be confronted by Liam (the drug dealer who now thinks he Owns her) He gives her a week to come back to him or he says all hell will break lose on her fathers club. To protect her father and the club she agrees and only has 5 days to return to Liam.Will Maddie let her father and Cole in on the deal she has made?

896980,B00JNXUPG4,"[0, 5]",2,"I must have missed the memo. When exactly did the word erotica become synonymous with abuse? This is complete drivel--cheap thrills and post Fifty Shade of Grey crap with a paranormal twist. Seriously, it is one big rape fantasy and glorification of abuse.The thing is, I can understand the rape fantasy part. I REALLY don't enjoy reading them (in fact, I had to force myself to finish this one), but I understand women who do. I totally get facing that fear on safe pages and forcing it into something you can garner a little excitement and fun from instead of just a terror inducing real possibility. I get that.What I don't get it why women, WOMEN (of which Ms. Lake is just one of many) would continue to write all females as mindless, volition-less, disposable commodities who rather enjoy their own abuse, up to and including death and dismemberment (and starting in childhood). This book is littered with quotes like this: This woman has suffered since the day she was brought into this world. Hasziel cupped her cheek and smoothed his thumb over her skin. It is the only place in which she finds comfort.What nonsense. This book even suggests that the female=tradable possession to be passed by a man to a man as reward belief exists even in Heaven. Wow, I bet that's what every good Christian woman dreams of when she prays for those pearly white gates.Why is this seen as sexy? Why is this so common that I'm tempted to call it clicheacute. Women in this book are collected, disparaged, drugged, raped (almost constantly as background noise), beaten, trained (which is a euphemism for being abused until they stop fighting back and become docile enough to be raped by others...but it's then presented as enjoying her position as sex slave), killed and dismembered. Meanwhile the MC is physically abused in some bastardized version of BDSM in which she has no control or realistic expectation of not being killed. In fact, she's terrified.Of course, she comes to love and crave it as an illustration of how all women really only want to be dominated, hurt and broken (and what good are they then?) by the men they love. (Thus, all those other women who have been abused and killed in the book probably enjoyed their rapes and murders too.) While simultaneously regaining memories of being gang raped by her father and his cronies, as if to suggest that any woman who desires something different than monogamous, vanilla sex must already have been defiled in some fashion. You'd think these were mutually exclusive, but apparently not.It's horrid. I went into this knowing it was a dark read. I'm no prude and enjoy the darker side of fiction (that's why I picked this book up in the first place), but that doesn't mean I wanted to spend 200+ being told how worthless my pssy and I are. I mean the whole concept of this book is that Xander can torture and kill people regularly, he can get head from a mindless sex slave, he can break women into said slave, he can kidnap, whip, and abuse Karinna, all with no heavenly repercussions. But god forbid his penls enter her v@gina, even in love, and he's condemned to Hell for all eternity. We women apparently aren't just worthless, our vileness is contagious.And let's not miss that it is essentially JUST women we're talking about. Almost as an afterthought Kid's are thrown in too (but one would presume they're at least half girls to start with and who know when boys age out of the victimizable children's group), but never, NEVER men. The book is very clear on this....Nothing more stony and unapologetic than a bitter angel forced to leave the heavens--even demons avoided the Fallen. Humans, on the other hand, couldn't avoid them if they tried. Every day, kids and females got snatched up from the streets like smelt in a shallow pond, drugged and used at the amusement of their sadistic captors.I could write an essay on the distancing technique being used in the use of 'female' instead of women, girls or a name (it crops up a lot). But I'll let that one go. What I really want to point out is that I'm always amazed that truly evil beings are still expected to adhere to strict heterosexual norms. Men are never victimised, be it in a any sort of homoerotic way or just, you know, basic power dynamics. Baffling.To wrap this up, I'd like it noted that at no point have I used the world misogynistic. Misogyny being the hatred of women and girls, but the word is often thrown around willy-nilly whenever a book or character treats women badly. I never got the impression that the author or even any of the cruelly dismissive men in the book hated women. To hate someone (as an individual or gender grouping) requires caring enough to have an opinion about them. It elevates them at least to the level of 'human enough to think about.'No one here did that. In a sense, I think this is worse. Women weren't hated. They were just not accorded any sense of human agency, or even faces as they're all masked as well as apparently thoughtless automatons. They were, as a whole, mere shadows that men act upon. I'm holding out hope that sometime in the near future the female population will realise that we're worth more than this.The book did try to redeem itself at the end by punishing the bad guys, but it was too little too late for me and really the exact same story could have been relayed without dehumanising every woman...excuse me, female...to pass the pages. (And been a darned good book too.) I'm giving this two stars and the only reason it's not a single star is that mechanically it's fairly well written. I like a spot of erotica here and again. I even like a bit of dark erotica. But I don't want to finish the book feeling like s*** about being a poor, pitiful, potentialess, penisless, disposable victim...i.e. a woman.","07 14, 2014",AUF0OPKICU6D4,Sadie Forsythe,1.5 **SPOILERISH**,1405296000,0.0,True,2.0

This is a walk around there world where the characters are people, not the caricatures that we're used to seeing on documentaries and in the media.One thing that I love that Saadia does, is that she makes the main character an outsider, but an outsider that is Other to us as well. We learn about him, and the others, through their reaction to what they're seeing. This way there's a lot more showing and a lot less telling.I also love the way that the history flows with the book.

There was a bit of a downward spiral, but I was glad for Gemma and Abe when everything worked out in the end! I did think that the story moved at a quick pace...sometimes a little too quickly for my taste. I would have liked a little more build up before the beginning of Abe and Gemma's romance, and I thought that the resolution to the 'problem' in the story came about just a little to quickly to make it believable. Break Me was written in the third person, which also tends to make me feel somewhat removed from the story...kind of like watching the moving when I'd rather be a part of it! I really liked that the story included perspectives of different characters throughout, as I'm always interested to see things from different points of view.Abe was SUCH a sweetheart of a book boyfriend, and I really loved the way he was with Gemma, giving her time and multiple reasons to learn to trust him. Gemma did have some maturing to do, so it was at times hard for me personally to identify with her at 28, but this would likely not be the case for younger adults to whom this story is targeted. In the end, the 'problem' in the story allowed both characters to mature and discover what they truly wanted and needed. I also loved that Gemma matured not only in her relationship with Abe, but also in her relationship with her family. This truly was somewhat of a coming-of-age story, as Gemma's experiences allowed her to grow and mature and to learn more about who she truly was.Break Me was very well-written!

Though fantasy romances aren't that high on my favorites list in the world of romance, even with the first couple of chapters Shawna Thomas managed to reel me in and hold my attention until it was difficult for me to imagine anything else but the wondrous world which she has spun so well in this novel.There are the good old-fashioned humans and a race known as the Svistra whose savagery and notorious thirst for blood and pillaging keeps the humans awake at night. 20 year old Selia lives on the Outskirts and is the owner of the tavern that her mother left behind upon her death 5 years back. Though well versed in the art of defending herself, when it comes to love and desire, Selia is an innocent all the way.When Selia rescues a man being beaten to death only to find out that he is a Svistra, the uncomplicated life that she has known till then changes completely, plunging her into a world filled with uncertainty, treachery, man's thirst for vengeance and war and last but not the least the possibility of finding ever lasting love in the last place she expects to find it.When Jaden's golden gaze lands on his savior little does he know that the fearless woman who stands before him would come to mean everything to him. Having turned his back on his own race because his ideas didn't mesh with that of his father who is the leader of the Svistra, Jaden makes his way through the many different terrains that makes up their world until his journey brings him to the Outskirts and Selia with her gentle giant of a companion Oren.Never having being one to turn away a man or animal in need, the forced intimacy that caring for an injured brings to light the fact that humans may not have the complete picture when it comes o the Svistra. Jaden proves to be the opposite of what Selia has believed to be of the Svistra until now and when time and time again Jaden proves his loyalty, honesty and integrity in boundless different ways, Selia is no match to her heart's yearning for a man whose mere presence alone is enough to send her whole world into a tailspin.Jaden might want to do the honorable thing and stay away when it comes to Selia but his heart's yearning for a woman who seals her fate unknowingly by joining him in the most scared manner possible is one that refuses to be denied. But Jaden knows that without going back and facing those whom he has left behind and winning over the treacherous ruler who leads the whole Svistra clans towards endless war, there would never be a peaceful future for either the humans or the Svistra.Opening up a world that has so many intriguing aspects to it that I couldn't help but want even a crudely drawn map of where everything was situated, Altered Destiny tells the tale of brave men and a woman willing to fight for what they believe in. Jaden's character is an alluring one, one who made my heart yearn for him and of course love him because he has that inner strength that lets him be true to himself and what he believes in. Jaden's honesty and integrity is what drew me most towards his character, and the way he is possessive of Selia even when he believes he has nothing of substance to offer her made my heart go pitter patter.Selia is a wonderful heroine whom I loved from the instance she couldn't turn her back on a wounded man. Even knowing that caring for a Svistra would end up in herself paying for it in blood doesn't stop her from doing what's right. The slow awakening of Selia's senses when it comes to Jaden is something to be savored. And a heroine who doesn't believe in being coy and has no qualms about being herself is one that always earns my wholehearted approval. Worthy of a mention is her relationship with Oren, a man gentle as he is huge, a character who will remain with me for a long time even after I am done with the book. His simplistic view on life, right and wrong proved to be quite refreshing in a novel that practically seeps with half truths and the treachery that goes right along with the hunger for ultimate power.Though there were certain aspects of the novel such as the occasional swear words which just felt out of place with the whole tone set for the rest of the story and the fact that the final showdown between Jaden and his brother never fully materialized in the novel, I still enjoyed this immensely and would definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.One character from the story that I would love a future book to be based on, if Ms. Thomas ever thinks of writing a sequel is Nathan. If Jaden had not been in the picture, I would have completely given myself over to him. And even with Jaden in the picture, his character nevertheless proved to be a compelling one, which is telling in itself how remarkable a talent Ms. Thomas has when it comes to creating her characters.Rating=4.5/5Reviewed by Maldivian Book Reviewer (MBR)","09 19, 2011",A576L6YAOW6IP,maldivianbookreviewer Book Reviews - From th...,"Wondrous world, characters  story!",1316390400,0.5,True,4.0

Victor is a homeschooled teen who wants to win admission to the higher tech university he wishes to go to.  To do this he decides to create a chatbot who can talk to people all over the world and answer questions by taking information from all the online places Victor has gone.  He is so focused on his chatbot creation that he seems to forget that he is on a cruise with a beautiful girl whom he likes.  Through text messages, web browsing, and emails Elizabeth, Henry, and Victor chat and try to figure out solutions to problems.  Some of those problems are teenage stuff like how Victor won't take time away from his computer to go with Elizabeth to see the sites off the ship or even to dinner with her on the ship.  Also, Henry has feelings for Elizabeth, but knows she likes Victor so he is a good friend and encourages her to do what she wants as far as trying to get Victor to notice her.  Then there are other problems that come up, like how Victor finally completes his chatbot, but it seems to be taking on a mind of its own and not in a good way.  It is causing problems for Victor and is hacking into all his personal stuff.  Can the three teens figure out a way to stop an unstoppable chatbot?  How can you shut something down that seems to know what you are going to do and when?After reading iDrakula I knew I had to check this book out too.  I found the book very interesting in how Victor builds his monster out of techy bits instead of used body parts.  He creates a monster, but in a different and more modern form...a chatbot.  I am not super familiar with Frankenstein, but was able to follow this book just fine.  It has the same theme to it, but in a different era.  I loved the chatbot theory and how they had to try and fight technology at its best to figure out if there was a way to stop V.V. the chatbot.  I also enjoyed the pictures Elizabeth took and sent out via her cell phone.  A touch of the past in a modernized story.  This was a quick and easy read for me, and I think that's what made it all that much more enjoyable to me.  I was able to read a good book written in a format that I use daily myself.  It was fun to read a story in the perspective of texts and emails that still made perfect sense to me.  The plot was engaging, the characters were great, and the writing was unique and enjoyable.

Dr. Sarah is so awkward and inside of her own head that you cannot help but love her. Jason is the perfect antidote to her buttoned up nature, with his oh-so-hot cop mentality. Of course, the rest of McNeils and the strong bond Jason has with his family make you love him just that much more.I'm struggling to write this review, not because the book was difficult to review but because I ABSOLUTELY adored it and I just want to gush, but I do not want to give too much away. I'm having a total fan-girl moment over here.Hannah's character just added this element of complete emotional connection to the book. I cried over some of her scenes.

I laughed, I cried, I gasped in suspense.I am a huge fan of cop dramas, but even on my favorite shows, I can usually figure out the plot. In the Shadow of Greed kept me guessing and the steamy romance between Jason and Sarah kept me distracted in the most delicioius way.

Typically you can find me with my nose in my NOOK with a romance novel. You know, the one where boy meets girl and she's swept off her feet. Yeah, that. Lately, I `ve been looking for something different. Something to bring me out of my book funk. This was it.Toxic is not your usual happy go lucky story. It hurts. It hurts to read. You become so wrapped up in the main character's story. I have never read anything by this author before, but I am now forever a fan. This was brilliant.Toxic is a story about Logan Reynolds and her life. From a child through her teenage and adult years, Logan had a rough life. The book is written in somewhat of a diary form, where every chapter is dated. I really enjoyed that because it allowed the story to flow nicely and you truly felt like you were on a journey with Logan.Logan was born to a drug addict and alcoholic mother.  Her father is not in the picture. The story begins where Logan has to get ready for her first day of kindergarten on her own. Yes, you read that correctly. She had to do it all on her own at five years old.A lot of the smaller kids have their Mama's with them, but I don't feel jealous because I don't want mine with me.I don't sleep at all. I never do when she holds me because it feels wrong. All I do is wonder if it's supposed to feel wrong when a Mama holds her baby girlMy heart went out to Logan. I think I truly enjoyed this story because Logan was real. The author did a great job at character development.  You felt the loneliness that Logan went through. Logan had a spirit, a fighting one, however as she get older she stopped fighting and gave in to her surroundings. The story followed her into her teen and young adult life. She succumbed to alcohol, drugs, and abuse. No that is not giving away the story. The events that occur during this time are heartbreaking. The human spirit is strong. Logan is proof of that.We're toxic, but only the best things areWere there boys in the story? Yes! But, not like you think. I love that the author involved love and romance but did not make it the focal point. There are boys in there that put Logan in unspeakable situations. My heart broke for her every time.Then there was Nathan...I just want you the way you areOh Nathan. Every girl could use someone like you in their lives.  I don't want to give too much away, but he is the knight that every girl deserves. He is reason. He is truth.Overall, I was absolutely blown away by this story. I am so glad I was given the opportunity to read and review this book. It reminded me why I love to read. It reminded me of how strong the human spirit truly is.

This 4th installment on the Consequences story was by far my most favorite hands down, no doubts about it.  The journey through Consequences, Truth, Convicted and Now the Missing Years, is one you won8217t forget and will most likely read again.  Tony was the one who I really wanted to get inside of his head, his oh so beautiful mind, but we also heard from Harry, John, Brent and Phil.  Seeing their perspectives of what was endured from Tony8217s Legal Troubles to Claire Being Institutionalized was eye opening.  Characters you don8217t think have that much to do with the story in fact step into the limelight and open your eyes.  Love isn't finding a perfect person. It's seeing an imperfect person perfectly.This entire series had me gripping my seat.  Aleatha did a fantastic job bringing all of the characters to light.  The Connection between Tony and Claire as well as how every other person you meet during the Consequences stories fall into place.  You find out what Meredith gained from talking to Claire.  Through the boys, Harry, Phil, John and Tony you really gain perspective on what Claire was going through when she was with Tony.  The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy or unfulfilled.  For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers ~ M. Scott PeckLove is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own and we saw this through this whole installment.  The love that Tony and Claire shared was real, raw, undeniable and unattainable by anyone else.  You could really see the hell, my bent, not broken lovely Tony went through to defend his true loves.  You could finally feel the hurt, experience the anger, guilt and heartache Tony endured.  Throughout the entire series, which I LOVED every single book, including the BHE companions I loved Tony, Loved to Hate to Love that Man.  He always made sure everyone knew actions have consequences, but when you see Tony himself finally face his and you will finally understand his reasoning behind all the madness.BHE Convicted- The Missing Years was a stunning conclusion to a mind-blowing, captivating series.  Courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.  That brave man is Tony Rawlings.  That beautiful stunning, strong brave man, that many of you may hate but I promise will not after this is that brave man.  He may be bent but he8217s certainly not broken, and anything not broken can always be pieced back together.  True love is never easy, but you overcome your fears and fight like hell to preserve it.Thank you Aleatha for allowing us to feel and fall in love with Tony and Claires journey!5+++++++++++ Stars for this one.

It's March of 2013!  I have not heard very much about The Education of Sebastian and am sad it is not getting the word of mouth spread around by readers that is deserves. I HIGHLY recommend this book to EVERYONE! I think it worries some readers of the age difference between Caroline (30) and Sebastian who is 17. Please don't let that stop you from reading this book and READ, READ, READ this novel. I promise you won't be disappointed!The Education of Sebastian is a sad, emotional novel that will pull on your heart. It is one of those books that will make you feel sad sad for everyone involved and of course the two main characters. Caroline is a 30 year-old married military wife to David. She only married David at the young age of 19 to get away from her mother who was not really a mother to young Caroline. Caroline and David never really loved each other, he in controlling and uses Caroline to help his status in the military of having the perfect young housewife. When first married the two get stationed in San Diego, this is where Caroline first meets an 8 year Sebastian. Caroline took care of Sebastian because his parents were alcoholic drunks who ignored him. They had a special relationship where sparked his interest in all things Italian. Caroline and David were transferred to the east coast, 9 years later returning to San Diego Caroline sees Sebastian again, this time he is 17 but looking more like a man in his 20's. As the two reconnect sharing stories of their horrible home life they begin a romantic relationship and fall in love, having to hide their affair while trying to plan a future... together.I loved everything about this book. I love the character of Caroline, my heart ached for her but not as much as Sebastian. Yes the age difference is a bit strange and took me a little bit to get into their romance, I won't lie. Once you read more of their relationship together and understand their connection I completely forgot about their age difference and wanted nothing more than for them to be able to have their happy ever after. I just knew their affair would come to heads and drama would unfold. I was anticipating it at every page. I kept thinking every time they would sneak around this would be the moment they would get caught.The ending is heart wrenching... oh my. My heart was breaking into a million tiny pieces. I started reading The Education of Caroline (The Education Of... 2) ASAP! I couldn't let their story escape me even for a moment. I am totally invested into Caroline and Sebastian.

With an unforgettable intense hot risky summer you can't help but get sucked into fast!At first when I started reading this I felt uncomfortable about Sebastian still being under age. Even though everything they did was all consentual. Still its a touchy subject matter seeing how a 30 year old married woman starts having an affair with a 17 year old teenager. Also the underage drinking parts too. I don't know what to exactly say about that! Yes its wrong. And its illegal in most states. At the same time your almost pulling for these two to work out because it comes across like they sincerely do love each other.I literally felt like I became Caroline in this story! I got so pulled into the storyline that I pictured everything in my head. And there was moments I felt anxious, moments I wanted to cry. Moments I felt so in love with Sebastian and felt like everything could come crashing down and get destroyed so fragilely. I think Sebastian is so amazing. I adored him. He's wise beyond his years. And theres also such a sympathetic factor going on with him.My heart went out to him the entire time the way his parents treated him like crap from the very beginning. They don't care about him at all. And his mom and dad are both selfish evil a-holes. And I hope in future books they get exactly what's coming to them!On the inside he has this beautiful soul. He's so full of energy, optimistic, so ready to grab life by the horns and absorb everything. I can clearly see how he's made Caroline come alive so much. Before him, she was just existing. Her husband David, who is a MAJOR a-hole too! lol Treats her like some piece of property that's just there to service his needs. He's a male chauvinist and he disgusted me the whole way through. I don't know how she hung on as long as she did. Because I couldn't stand David from the get go. I feel like Sebastian was this shining light that came into her life to bring her out of the lifeless darkness that she was sinking further and further into. She was going through the motions and not really living and experiencing life as she should until him.I knew Brenda was another one that couldn't be trusted. You b**** brenda! LOL In hindsight she's the one that really started to ball rolling to destroy everything. I think she wants Sebastian back desperately. And she's willing to do whatever it takes, even be downright ruthless to get there.Sometimes I felt uncomfortable reading the sex scenes. You can't help but think its hot because8230well its described so sensuously that its8230just hot! But at the same time in the back of my mind I kept remembering this guy is 17! This woman is 30. Would it make so much of a difference when she's 45  he's 32? Nope. But I think when it comes to still being a minor it puts a whole new twist on things. I do think its brilliant of the author to write the story this way.

I really loved the history that was woven into the story. I have always loved Native American culture, so naturally I just soaked up the stories, legends, and history told. Then there's Skylar and Rafael, oh lord, they have made themselves right at home at the top of my favorite list! Their relationship and how it evolves is so precious. I loved how Skylar would catch Rafael staring at him, and through the writing, you just knew how Rafael felt about him. Not to mention his love for books, and his drawing... loved when Skylar would look over at him, and his nose would be in a book, or he would be drawing... obvious to the world, around him. But always knew what Skylar was doing, or thinking. Skylar is just adorable, there is no other word I can describe him as. Having no voice, he is always smiling, always concerned about everyone else. So sweet, and innocent. Their relationship is a slow process, but so enjoyable to read. The story involves everyone on the Reservation, and you can't help but love everyone.This series is really a amazing read, the writing is fabulous, Rose Christo is an amazing story teller, and advocate. She really sheds light on the many issues plaguing her people, and after learning about these (more then horrifying) issues, I was very eager to go off and read more, and sign the petitions she offered.Highly recommend this series, and anything by Rose Christo!

Now, it seems that history is repeating itself, as her Mom had been in the same situation with her, and never pursued her big city reporting dreams, instead working it the small-town family paper and raising her child alone.Drake Everett was the popular jock in high school, who stood her up for their one date. When Drake walks back into her life with an apology and an explanation, Marly realizes things aren't always what they seemed. Drake and Marly both have secrets, past and present to work through. Marly also has to work through her misconceptions about Drake, and figure out whether her dreams of the future are hers or her mother's.I like Marly. She is a real person who is trying to make her way though her situation is not what she planned. The character is well-developed and I enjoyed her interactions. I like Drake, as well, he is not at all what is expected by Marly or her Mom.

Not to mention that his existence as a Sioacutega Feiceann has been confirmed. While those of his kind are labeled as Fae assassin's, he knows he's not a threat to the Light Fae world. In fact, he's an avid supporter, and would do anything to aid Max with anything he needs.When his protection becomes compromised, Tony is forced to flee to the one place he never thought he'd set foot in ever again. His uncle is less than pleased to see him, and yearns to send him back to his mother's arms. Unfortunately, that's something that won't happen just yet. The Unseelie threat has become far more cumbersome than anyone could have ever imagined, and it must be vanquished, at all costs.Allowed to reside with his uncle for the time being, he soon begins to learn the in's and out's of his unique heritage. Granted, being a Sioacutega Feiceann isn't as easy as it sounds. Never-the-less, Tony is quite willing to learn as much as possible in order to lend his uncle and those beneath his tutelage a helping hand.Ironically, there's one thing he never counted upon: Jillian O'Neal. Her sudden appearance has rocked his world in more ways than one. The fact that he finds himself greatly attracted to her does nothing to deter him from the task at hand, however. Although, he cannot deny that he's drawn to her as they spend more and more time together.Tony vows to protect her from the danger crawling towards their very doorstep. While she may be a tad reluctant to allow himself to do so, she finds it hard to remain at arm's length from him for long. Deep inside, they're tied to one another, even if they won't admit it. He soon learns more about himself than he ever thought possible. He, Max, and his new friends will need to set their differences aside if they're to band together in hopes of vanquishing the oncoming evil, once for all.This was truly a lovely addition to the Soul Mates series. I enjoyed it immensely. This takes up a little ways after Soul Mate ends, and lends further insight to the existing war between the Fae and the Unseelie kingdom. It was nice to see Max and Tony grow stronger in the face of such adversity. The brief glimpses into Max and Anna's world as parents was certainly endearing. I did encounter a couple spots where certain punctuation was missing/grammar needed to be fixed, but I didn't let that deter me from enjoying the story itself. I look forward to what comes next for this very intriguing series.Please Note: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","02 8, 2013",AAZ1SFT4AD94U,N.

I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Sabine is still close to her former brother- in-law and when he asked her to do him a favor by participating in a charity fundraiser Sabine goes along. It seems there is to be a bachelor auction and Sabine is to rescue a man named Todd by bidding on him .  Sabine is under the impression Todd is gay and is only participating in the auction because of his company and because he still hasn't fully disclosed his sexual preference.  But, the joke is on Sabine when she bids on Todd only to discover she bought the wrong Todd.Todd is a Hawaiian native and a celebrity TV chef.  He's hot stuff and is sought after for his looks and fame.  But, Todd is tired of all that and wants a woman that likes him for who he is really is, not the celebrity persona.  After the infamous auction,  Todd discovers Sabine's motives for buying him and so they know where they stand right from the start.  That doesn't stop Todd from planning Sabine a wonderful home cooked meal. What Sabine discovers is that Todd is really a nice down to earth guy and she finds she is very attracted to him and not just because he looks like sex on a stick.So, what's the problem?  Well, Sabine's ex-husband cheated on her and then before the ink was dry on the divorce papers he had already remarried. With two children in college and staring straight at the big  4 0 ,  and like most of us in real life, there are few extra pounds around the mid- section,  Sabine's confidence isn't very high and she's just not sure she is ready to date at all,  much less date someone younger than her and famous to boot.As the media pounces on the romance, Todd and Sabine try to keep things low key, but Todd is getting serious about Sabine.  Will Sabine be ready to make a commitment on the same level as Todd or will her insecurities prevent her from taking a second chance on love?This novel is short and sweet,  a great way to end the day or pass your lunch hour with.  A feel good story with real romance .  There are steamy moments too, but there is real depth and feeling in Todd and Sabine's relationship.  They both know they have found the right person for them and even if there are a few lingering moments of doubt these two will have their happy ever after.This one gets a 3.5 rounded to 4.","05 22, 2014",AVO3NDENWYHEH,gpangel,Short and sweet- Good Combination of Sweet Romance and Steamy Romance,1400716800,0.0,False,4.666666666666667

These are toys that are no longer played with but are taking up space in the house and yard.This book introduces children to the process of sorting toys, deciding which ones to find new homes for and then sharing with others.Cloot had many, many toys - a lot he never used. Every space in his room was full of toys. They were in the drawers, under his bed and scattered all over his floor. Cloot had a storage shed in the yard that was also full of toys. Some were broken and some needed new batteries. It was a real mess.One day Cloot's dad suggested that Cloot should give some of the toys away. At first, Cloot did not want to give any of the toys away. How would he choose which ones to give away? He finally came up with a plan to help him decide. Cloot gathered all his toys and spread them on the ground. His dad helped him choose toys to give to boys and girls at the hospital. They boxed them up and Cloot spent the afternoon giving them out.Soon all the kids from the neighborhood were bringing their toys to share with the children in the hospital. Clutter Cut Inc. was a great success.My favorite thing about this book is that it teaches young children how to decide what to keep and what to give away. This is a difficult skill to learn, even for big kids. This book goes through the process of sorting, choosing, boxing and giving things to others. If children learn this process at a young age, it will be so much easier to live a clutter-free life in adulthood.","07 6, 2011",A2BE9VAS3RZ78R,Janette Fuller,Teach Kids To Deal With Clutter,1309910400,0.0,False,5.0

But right from the start this book is different in a couple of ways-- its written from a male point of view and Audouin-Mamikonian does that very well. It was refreshing to read a book from the main male character. Secondly the main character Indiana, is not a werewolf and the book centers on him dealing with that fact in a werewolf world. This book is also from an author that I have never read anything from before so I was interested to dive in. In the end it was a fun, quick, and fast paced read with likeable characters. Actually I read it in one night.Indian Teller - the main character in this story. He is the mostly human grandson of the leader of the werewolves. Indiana's father was a werewolf but his mother was human ---with a gift.Growing up in the pack of werewolves but not being one made Indiana's life difficult. His humor, intelligence and resilience throughout the book make him a likeable and relatable character that you root for throughout the book. At the age of 18 years old Indiana convinces his Grandparents to allow him to go to college where he meets Tyler - an adversary, and Kat - a love interest.The story had mystery in the form of Indiana's mothers gift, betrayal from someone within the pack, love, members of the same race coming to odds with each other, and help from an unlikely source.The ending tied up a lot of loose ends while still leaving huge openings for the story to continue in a second book. I will definitely be picking up that book up when it comes out.[...]","12 11, 2013",A3TJOHA5LYI9Y9,Jennifer,A Great Fresh Look at SuperNatural,1386720000,0.0,False,4.0

Jared reluctantly gives the riveting Lacy a ticket as he never lets anyone off with a warning! Yet, he is intrigued, as is Lacy. Imagine their surprise when they both meet up again at the very bar that Lacy was headed to for Angela's party. After getting a thorough set down from her manipulative sister, Angela, Lacy is obliged to play one of her little games.Jared Kelly found himself attracted to Lacy while at the traffic stop and never imagined that she would end up being related Angela. He has already been on the receiving end of Angela's machinations. Jared isn't too keen on going with the kiss me request on the cocktail napkin, but he can't deny that he wouldn't mind exploring something more with Lacy. However, he isn't too eager when he believes that Lacy and Angela are cut from the same cloth. Angela continues her dirty dealings as these two try to work something out. Will they be able to ignore the vindictive woman, or will their budding relationship crash before it ever takes off?Kiss Me started out as such a hot, unique story that pulled me in from the moment they made eye contact. However, it soon let me down rather abruptly.Angela was a POW that never seemed to get her comeuppance and despite the fact that both Jared and Lacy claimed they were going to change, the proof was never there in Kiss Me. Lacy continually ran when the going got tough and, frankly, Jared ventured down that road as well. Jared wanted to protect Lacy, but I never saw any evidence of this protection in Kiss Me. He let Angela verbally abuse both Lacy and him, and he said nothing to the little shrew.In the end, Jared and Lacy were the perfect couple for each other in Kiss Me as they deserved one another. I was eagerly anticipating the knockdown of spoilt Angela, but I found I was disappointed in the end. Jared wasn't always consistent either. He claimed he never lets people off with a warning. However, he lets Angela off with one, which made it look like Jared cared more about Angela than he said he did. Kiss Me made it look plausible that Jared was looking to strike back at Angela for dumping him by hooking up with Lacy, and that was a little frustrating. Lacy seemed to not understand that she wasn't thwarting another's advances and rewarding them for their good behavior, either. She was giving in and letting someone else pull her around and allowing the opportunity to be called a few names too in Kiss Me.There was no real growth in Lacy or Jared other than what they vocalized, but they never truly showed in Kiss Me. However, Lacy's aunt was very amusing!

They seem to create characters that spark my interest and make me want to just keep reading. I can actually see everything they are showing me and I like that in a story I have purchased to entertain me. I was able to clearly see myself in the Square Peg (the Gay friendly bar owned by the 2 main character's) having a drink and chatting with Vin the bartender. I was able to immerse myself in this book and I quite enjoyed the vacation from my real life.The story starts with Benjamin, a mild mannered accountant by day, inheriting half interest in a gay bar from his estranged father. Shane was the live above the bar longtime manager who now owns the other half. The instant squabbling between the two was entertaining and very understandable. Ben has a business and numbers background and has big plans to improve the bar while Shane has a history with the place and no desire to change a thing. More arguing ensues when the true problems Square Peg faces comes to light and both men have to learn to compromise. A sexual chemistry that burned up my Kindle adds another level to their already shaky partnership. When they finally got their HEA, I had to just sit back and exhale.....loudly ... and smile because these guys really had to work for it.The BDSM aspect was fairly nicely done. I admit to a slight squick regarding two small (or maybe not so small) things that Ben does to Shane. One is a slap across the face and another is a slap to Shane's head.  It threw me a bit because as many BDSM themed books as I have enjoyed (M/M and M/F) I have never seen that type of discipline meted out. I was able to remind myself that Ben was brand new to his Dom kink and that together they were just feeling their way but it just did not sit well with me. It was not violent per say nor repeated throughout the story so I was able to finish the book and enjoy it but for some this could be a red flag. Ben was seriously possessive of Shane and the writers really made it obvious that Shane and Ben had a very loving relationship that included a BDSM element but it very easily could have read differently. It's a fine line IMHO so just beware.The secondary characters were incredible. I am not so silently hoping that we will get Vin's story sometime soon please?? He could almost have stolen the show from our main men and I loved him. All in all I would recommend Square Peg to those who love their M/M with angst, heat, romance and a well-deserved HEA.

How on earth were they going to be part of a young adult paranormal romance? Boy was I wrong. These gargoyles are a pack of extremely good looking, romantic, and tough, young men. Mix Jacob's wolf pack with Edward's vampire family, throw in a pinch of boy band, and you have an idea of the gargoyles. LOVED IT.

I didn't really know what to expect when I started it, and was surprised at how much of this particular gargoyle mythology we got, especially considering how short it was. Gargoyles in packs, being able to turn human when the sun hits them, being basically indestructible when in stone form, those are fairly expected, I think. But we also got quite a bit of info on how the pack actually works, who leads, how they make decisions, etc. It was anthropologically interesting.MacKenzie was an interesting heroine. She is very matter-of-fact (to the point where she seems emotionally detached at times) and obviously tries to be a good person.

Discovering the story involved a graphic artist and a monster-makeup creator just made me even more interested in reading it.Trip is a graphic artist with a secret crush on his editor and colleague, Cliff, who is completely straight and, as far as I can tell, is just using Trip for his genius artistic abilities. I mean, let's face it, Big Dog Comics is getting a serious amount of art out of Trip but not allowing him to script anything other than the bland stuff all because Trip is an idiot and keeps hoping Cliff will notice him and all of a sudden discover he's gay. Not gonna happen, buddy. Plus, the comic he does the art for is seriously staid about a bunch of high school kids. There's no sex, no blood, just issues about acne and peer pressure. Boring! Good thing Trip accepts commissions because otherwise he thinks his brain might ooze from his ears. Life looks up when he meets Silas at the zombie run. Silas is hot, even in full zombie makeup, and Trip thought he was flirting with him but they both forgot to exchange numbers. Now, Trip is trying a little subterfuge to locate Silas, and really hoping it works.Silas does FX makeup for the stars, and his specialty is gore and wounds. What a thing to put on a resume, huh? He's so mad when he can't find Trip again during or after the race because he thought they had some chemistry. Silas is a lot different than Trip in the dating department. I guess it's easiest to just say that Silas has had a lot, and I mean a lot, of hookups and short-term dating, but something about Trip makes him wonder if there isn't more to life. When Trip tracks him down and calls him, Silas is ecstatic and they meet for dinner. It's a bit of an odd first date as Trip is still upset at Cliff stealing his pitch for a new comic and having someone else draw it. What? So, Silas and Trip sort of stumble around each other in that first date nightmare. The second date goes much better and they both are realizing how much chemistry they have together, and this is before anything physical!Rina and Trip do a brainstorming session where the character of Scratch, an incubus, is created and a basic idea is born for a very graphic novel for adults. While Trip is drawing and thinking and doubting, he and Silas continue to date and when things do get physical it's pretty intense. I completely and totally fell for Trip and Silas. Both of them so hesitant to trust, to open up, to be vulnerable, even as they are doing those exact things. I loved how they brought out the best in each other and how they managed to come up with ideas for Scratch when they would just be talking to each other. Not brainstorming, just regular conversations where something Silas says would light a match in Trip's brain. Trip makes Silas feel valued and cared about and Silas makes Trip feel like he can do anything and his talent and ideas have value. Silas encourages Trip to try and interest publishers and fans in Scratch at the next comic convention, but Trip is scared and has a lot of doubts. What if he loses his guaranteed work with Big Dog, or loses the respect of his fans and others in the industry when he introduces a gay incubus graphic novel? Which he's not even finished with? Trip thinks it's way too risky and Silas thinks you need to risk to win.What a fantastic book! Damon Suede really knows how to keep my attention, and considering this is a fairly long novel, that is saying quite a bit. I was on pins and needles waiting to see if Trip would finally see Cliff for the giant a-hole he is and see how much he played on all of Trip's fears and doubts in order to use him. God, I despised Cliff! I wasn't so sure how I felt about Trip at the end, because it's really all his fault what happens, and I personally felt he got off easy in the blame game. I adored Silas, every single inch of him and want one for myself. I absolutely adored this book. The writing is phenomenal, the characters are fantastic, the psychology is real, and the sex is hot.

A distraction she doesn8217t need especially when this turns into a real humdinger case of who-done-it.  The murder turns out to be the tip of the iceberg and Laney uncovers a huge case of debt, drugs and deceit.  The likes she never thought she8217d see in her small town.

That scene made me love her character, because she knew who she was and she wasn8217t willing to give up who she was in order to make the guy happy.Hunter. He was a bit intense at times, but he was a likeable love interest. He wasn8217t overbearing, and he genuinely seemed to have Rosie8217s best interests at heart. At times he did come off as a bit too perfect, but I still liked him.The scenes with Hayley and Rosie. Like I said, I preferred Ripped to Burned, and that8217s mainly because Hayley8217s story was a lot of fun. Having her pop up in Burned was great. Her scenes with Rosie were light, but they also highlighted their strong relationship as sisters.The ending. The ending was perfect for this story. It was sweet and it helped to tie up loose ends in the story.What I didn8217t like:Rosie, at times. The fact that she wanted to take all of the blame for Hunter leaving (before she8217d given him a chance to really explain himself) bothered me, especially because it did become a bit repetitive.The ending. I know, I know. I said I liked the ending, and I did. But I also felt as though it was rushed. After the end of Chapter Nine, it seemed like things jumped forward a bit too quickly with Chapter Ten.Overall, I enjoyed Burned. It wasn8217t as strong as Ripped, but it was still enjoyable.","06 13, 2014",AWKDTHEV8HF5T,Nicole's YA Book Haven,More like 3.5 stars.,1402617600,0.0,False,3.0

Get on it!We were introduced to Kat in Rules of Entanglement as she is Vanessa's sister. If I'm being honest, I wasn't a fan. When Kat's name had been mentioned previously drama always ensued. Well, I was wrong. There, I said it. I was being judgy and now that I've had a formal introduction she broke my heart and had me rooting for her from the get go. There is really no way you can't. This girl has been through hell. And now she is running from a situation caused by an ex boyfriend and because he is in jail she is left alone to meet a deadline or to face the consequences.Enter the hero (in EVERY sense of the word) Aiden Irish O'Brien. Now I love my book heroes hot, alpha, bossy and dirty. And I absolutely know that Aidan has an alpha personality hiding in the recesses. But he knew simply from observing Kat for as long as he did that she needed to be healed and that she needed something different from him and he delivered. From the beginning Aidan was genuine, tender and willing to protect Kat. I get all warm and fuzzy just thinking about it. That's exactly why I fell in love with Irish. He was exactly what she needed. Strong arms to hold and protect her and a huge heart that knew how to handle her and treat her with the respect she deserved. And I loved that Kat recognized what Irish was for her and that she accepted him and let him in with little fight. So after distancing themselves from the people they loved, because they believed it was better to be alone than to put the ones they loved in danger, Aidan and Kat come together and learn that wounds can heal and that everyone deserves to love and be loved and that it is worth fighting for!","01 13, 2014",A2CM8FV0PZDQQ6,Suzyq39,"5 Sweetheartt, please Stars",1389571200,1.0,True,5.0

A huge twist in the story comes when we learn that all of Heather's dreams of her new life at college with her handsome classmate Nick are merely dreams while she is really in a coma. Heather must figure out the truth of her past, what memories are real and which are imagined as well as finding herself in the process.I thought that the voice of Heather was very realistic and believable - it seemed like the dialogue used was taken right out of a teenage girl's mind. The problems that Heather faces in the book are all things that readers can identify with, which makes her easy to identify and empathize with. I felt that this book was well written and had a great flow - like I mentioned, it felt like I was getting an inside glimpse into a teenage girl's mind during stressful and frightening experiences. This was a very interesting read with some realistic and deep issues, but it was intriguing to see how the main character and her friends/family dealt with the issues that came about throughout the book.

While her boyfriend and the police look for them, the novel hones in on the private hell the dancer is going through at the hands of a man who is intent on purging his hatred on her.The narrative voice is strong from the outset:`Joe Cafeacute opened in 1969 with no fanfare. It was a small-fronted diner. The kind of place that looks old for no discernible reason, dirty though it is impeccably clean.'Stylistically the novel is both elegant and dark, moving between evocative descriptive passages and sharp edge dialogue. Using flashbacks it gets you inside the killer's head and Mader cleverly manages to allow you to see the reasons Chet Mooney has ended up this way. This is one of the strengths of Joe Cafeacute, it digs behind the behaviour of the characters and gets beneath the skin. In its thematic darkness and narrative style Joe Cafeacute is a Noir novel and a fine one at that.Mader has also structured his first novel brilliantly, moving with ease between the different perspectives of the characters. After the first chapter it is extremely hard to put down. You are pulled into the maelstrom of events sparked off by the abduction. Mader has a native elegance to his prose that offsets the more disturbing aspects of the novel.The descriptions of being held captive and the physicality of the experience are powerfully told:`The hardest part is mental. We get used to having stimuli pounding into our brains. We get used to traffic and billboards and radio cures for baldness. Being in a dark room, tied to a chair, is an agony few experience.'Sara's imprisonment is the physical centre of the narrative as attempts to rescue her are made.This is a sharply written highly readable novel that takes you to the dark side, I highly recommend it.","10 7, 2011",A2J4GZH4B9LXPY,Richard Godwin Author Of Apostle Rising,Tight Noir,1317945600,1.0,True,5.0

I was giddy with anticipation and was glad I only had 10 more pages to read in the book in my hand so I could jump right to this one.  An hour and a half later, I was glad I choose to forego sleep so I could spend the wee hours of the morning with Todd, Ben and Erin.For those that may not have read picked up any of the Brown Sibling books, Todd, Ben and Erin are from the first book in the series, Laid Bare.  The threesome have had to overcome personal and family  prejudices, emotional devastation and learning compromise between friends to lovers in order to get to their HEA.  As Laid Open begins, we can see that everything they went through made them a stronger unit and created a family that is filled with love.  And in any family unit, no matter how strong, mommy and daddy (or daddies in this case) need some alone time to solidify those bonds.Laid Open gives us an opportunity to see how Todd, Ben and Erin decompress from the trials and tribulations of home and reconnect with each other.  Let me tell you...it's freaking hot.  Not only do they strengthen their ties as a threesome, but Ben and Todd take their relationship to a higher level of closeness.It was wonderful catching up with the three of them and seeing just how much they have grown from their book.  There are still emotional scars they must deal with, but they have truly built a unified front that could probably withstand just about anything...together.This was the perfect 'taste' of the Browns to tide me over until Tart comes out.

It was easy to breeze through each book with excitement and curiosity. I must commend the author's ability to pen in a well-written and creative way that allows for adults to shamelessly read paranormal romance and for young adults to read epic fantasy.Drowning Mermaids was engaging immediately as it allows the series to start on a very high note. It combined all the elements of romance with mystery and mystique as well. In Fathoms of Forgiveness, we turn to a much more high-stakes story with an unbelievable amount of conflict. It felt as if I was caught between the odds as Visola was. There is so much to learn and process from both Drowning Mermaids and Fathoms of Forgiveness about relationships and communication.In Boundless Sea, the author, Nadia Scrieva, takes a dramatic move and involves political, geographical, and social shifts that would be difficult for any reader to conceptualize at a surface level. Yet somehow, this incredible book makes those difficult mental leaps seamless and flawlessly delivered. Boundless seas made an incredible impression on me, and may be my favorite of all three. I just think that it is an untouchable book that stands out among similar books in the genre.In the last book of the series, Abyssal Zone brings much unfinished business to a close. As part of a bitter homecoming, the royal Aazuria finds herself in unfamiliar territory. She bravely navigates through her troubles with the wisdom and selflessness that we would expect from someone so regal. Embodying a true heroine, Abyssal Zone, ends the series on a spectacular note.Reading this collection is borderline life-changing.

When the embodiment of her dreams, Jason, saves her from being eaten by a vicious treadmill, her life (and his!) is never going to be the same.Comments:- Quite a long book (5074 kindle locations).- Bedroom scenes are spicy rather than erotic (not particularly frequent), all m/f with constant references to gay friend and cross-dressing.- It is a different/original take on the human/Shifter relationship (redneck hunters vs suited Shifters), with lots of story and plot.- When I picked up this book, it was on some sort of promotion and thus $0. It isn't now. However, as stated by another reviewer, the cost of the book doesn't really affect my view of the book. Either it's good or it isn't. And because cost fluctuates, it is unfair to judge it based on price.Opinion:This book is quite funny, and enjoyable, however I didn't like it enough to search out Book 2. The characters are strong and interesting enough but the book could have been half the size and still covered the same material. There isn't anything particularly wrong with this book, it does okay for a light Shifter book.

Yes, Seth and Lucy's story was worth all my eye rolls.What made this story so enjoyable to me were the characters. Lucy was smart, caring and a great person all around. She felt real. She struggled with her emotions with her boyfriend but faced the truth of her relationship with him. What I admired most about her was her determination to find her own way and the way she faced her fears of the unknown about both relationships before acting out. She questioned, she pondered and did whatever was best for her. Her only fault was confronting those issues head on with the men in her life, but really who doesn't need a bit more time to get their head on straight?Seth was great, I loved him from the start. I enjoyed his sense of humor, his tenacity at getting to the bottom of what Lucy was making him feel and his caring ways. His story was sad, but that just made his new-found happiness that much more enjoyable to me.Needless to say that the chemistry between the two was explosive. From the moment they laid eyes on each other you could feel how strong their attraction for each other was. And that first encounter? Man, that was hot! Kudos to Deanna Chase for building up the anticipation and keeping me captivated throughout.But really, I would have to say that my favorite parts were when they were just hanging around, sharing their experiences and cementing their connection. I wish I could have seem more of that, but what was brought to the page was enough for me to cheer them on. I loved what they each brought out from one another. Together they were happy not just content.

So I though, given the use of the word hypnotic in the title, that we would be going down those roads.Well, not really, but sort of.  Pratt discusses the power of language, and particularly metaphors - one of my favorite language tools - in getting people to come around to your way of thinking.He discusses the science, history, and magic of the metaphor, comparing it to a sort of verbal voodoo doll.

I enjoy the way the writers can write about things that happened back in the 1800's and in such a way that it was almost as if they were there themselves.  Passing their stories onto you that they had experienced while in that time.  Now even with genres that you love, there is always something about it that would drive you crazy.  And as much as I love Historical Romance, at times it seems as though the stories can drag on.While reading this book, at first it was the cover that had grabbed my attention.  The blurb was also extremely well written.  With paranormal books being one of the big sellers on the market, it was also great that two genres that I love would be combined.  There aren't that many books that have a historic value as well as a paranormal.During the course of this book, it was interesting to see the way that the characters interacted with each other.  You could tell their desire to be with each other, yet you could also tell how hard they were fighting that desire.  The interesting part of this story was the twist as to how Draven became a werewolf.Isabella's character showed a strength that not a lot of women had during that time.  She shows her devotion to her family when she agreed to a marriage to help her father out her desire to have children, because she would take care of other's children while wishing for her own.  She also shows that she won't be pushed around by her husband, that she is her own person.While this book did have its parts where it dragged on, and I wished that something would happen, it was a good book overall.","06 7, 2013",A1OO1T6GAZS9,Crystal's Many Reviewers,An interesting read.,1370563200,0.0,False,4.0

A Predator Priest details the story of one of these devils disguised as a priest, Bernard Bissonette, and the tragic impact he had on one Connecticut family, the Deary's, and other communities he was transferred to serve.  Margolick's story illustrates the utter failure of an institution to protect those it is intended to serve.  Not only did the Church turn a blind eye to the abuse of children taking place by priests, it was complicitous by simply shuffling these rotten people to other locations so they could continue their vile and disgraceful behavior.  The Deary's story and the actions of individuals like Bishop Reilly illustrate this all too clearly (and disappointingly).  All this is captured in an objective and harrowing way that will leave any reader, particularly Catholic ones frustrated and angry to the point of questioning their faith in their Church.While Bissonette is a reprehensible person, the most disturbing thing this book documents is the Church leadership, the Diocese, Bishops and Archbishops, who willfully ignore the pleas of their flock and the incontrovertible evidence of evil in their midst.  They made the victims feel as if they were in the wrong, willfully covering up this issue rather than confronting it head on and defrocking the monsters in their midst.  This is a disturbing, frustrating and tragic topic, but Margolick does the topic justice so we won't forget and can prevent such institutional failure from ever taking place again -- and we can put people like Bissonette where they belond, behind bars.","08 7, 2011",A14WCM5XDC1UT3,William Capodanno,The Evil Wolf Dressed in Sheep's Clothes,1312675200,0.8333333333333334,True,5.0

Daegan has been quite a mystery in the series thus far, so I loved getting inside his head and seeing everything that he has gone through.Even though this novella technically takes place before the events in Silent Orchids I do recommend waiting to read this novella until after you've delved into the world Wylie has created in the first novel. While I was still able to understand certain concepts and world building, I do feel if you haven't read the first book you may be a bit at a loss. Wylie does include a dictionary of terms at the end, which was also really helpful.As a child, Daegan was forced to witness something that no child ever should and was forced to be brave and strong when he should have had someone to comfort him. Now, 16 years later, he is a warrior and takes his role as a Ferrishyn very seriously. I really enjoyed reading this and seeing all of the obstacles Daegan had to face and how he was led to Kaeleigh.We also get to see Halister, who is not only Daegan's best friend, but he is also like a brother to him. Where Daegan is stoic and focused, Hal is more light-hearted and outgoing. Yet, Halister always has Daegan's back and vice versa. I loved their camaraderie.I don't want to spoil anything, but things are definitely not as they seem and evil is lurking around every corner. There are times Daegan is not in control of his own self and I am desperate to know what is the cause of this!There are so many unseen forces at work in Alandria and I am beyond intrigued to see how it will all come together and how it will turn out.

She is a talented, gifted artist who meets Daniel when he has his two children pose for a portrait. He is mesmerized by this young woman who seems so childlike and innocent. Together they battle opposition in the press where they tear Jenny apart by her limitations, by family whose concern is for either one of them hurting the other and themselves, wondering if a relationship between them is possible. Jenny has softened the hardened heart that Daniel developed when his first wife left. Together they show that the most important thing is seeing with the heart. Would definitely recommend the book.

The only consolation is, the series continues.The author writes with a relaxed, authoritative style, never rushing through scenes, yet never dragging them out or belaboring the point. It begins with Captain Block, a rather unusual dwarf, choosing a young warrior to accompany him on a delicate political mission -- to locate House Deskata lost heir, thereby averting war. Known for his instincts and his jeweler's eye, Block chooses Tilda Lanai, who is sworn to fight and die for the Deskatas. Along the way, they encounter Dugan, an ex-soldier, and gradually your typical fantasy fellowship is formed: the swordsman, the cleric/fighter, the healer, the wizard, and so on. The author handles these archetypes deftly, giving each a distinct persona and backstory. They function well in his perfectly-imagined world, where magic and muskets coexist with dragons, hobgoblins, and entire hierarchy of devils.If you enjoy fun adventure stories with engaging characters, give this one a try.","01 9, 2013",A11DGJT9JUO8KN,Penelope Reads,Fantasy Is Fun Again,1357689600,0.5,True,5.0

A few of the scenarios I guessed at earlier as something that may happen - and they did, but that didn't take away from the story.

54892,B004SZ3J6A,"[0, 0]",5,"Having somewhat stumbled on the name Desmond Cory not too long ago I gained an appreciation for spy thriller novels and in a desperate scramble to catch up on the works of this superb writer I decided to track down his first creation, the one that gave birth to Johnny Fedora, a very likable British spy.The Secret Ministry, Cory's first masterpiece in a long succession of a spy thriller series, published in 1951, is where I began my quest to work my way through his works. Hoping that I had read a later `Johnny Fedora' novel would not perhaps in some way spoil my enjoyment, I slowly and a little cautiously began flicking my way through. Any apprehensions I had were soon to evaporate as page after page was consumed every eagerly.As with the first of Cory's novels that I read, Dead Man Falling, Secret Ministry is set in the period following World War II and once again Johnny is faced with Nazi no-good activities. Continuing a murdering campaign in England that was not going un-noticed and needed to be stopped for good - step in Johnny Fedora.I found the pace at which the story was told, plots and sub-plots developed were consistent with my previous experience, adding to my pleasure. The early stages of the story begin quite slowly but it all comes together a little later. A little patience may be required for some people but that virtue is well rewarded. Although there was frequently an element of guessing what was coming next it did not become too taxing (I have a lively and active imagination), and what came next was surprising for me several times, serving to add to the suspense, entertainment and enjoyment of reading.Desmond Cory successfully combines intrigue, suspense and humour and has a creative flare in the descriptions of current story environments and I am really beginning to have some serious admiration for this highly talented author and perhaps it should come as no surprise he had some 16 novels in the Johnny Fedora series over a period of 20 years.I gauge my pleasure of a novel by how long I can sit down and just read. A novel that is capable of holding my attention for more than one hour without a break gets a big `thumbs up' from me.  Secret Ministry deserves two thumbs!  Is it worthy of a 5 star review? Would a shadow of doubt!","11 22, 2012",A2HP20L24G3L5,Neil,Another Desmond Cory triumph!,1353542400,0.0,False,5.0

For another I didn't know some acidity, especially in the stomach, is necessary in order for food to be broken down and assimilated. I thought the goal was 100% alkalinity, but the author Jake Hargis, explains otherwise.  He also says stress contributes to acidity, which makes so much sense. The book also gives you specific markers on how to spot how alkalinity has manifested in your body.Finally there are simple actionable steps you can take to remedy the situation.

This book includes Erotic fun, passion, laughs, heartache, betrayal and sweet revenge in this story.If you found out your fantasy worthy crush was leaving the company would you try and get a chance to seduce him?  Even if it meant going out of your comfort zone in order to do it?  I think most of us would.Gia Reynard has a job at Tri-Solutions which she likes but there is a hot guy also working there Luke Monroe, the company golden boy, that she likes but the company has a fraternization policy that prohibits relationships.  So one night when she and her three closest friends are having a gab fest she blurts out she would love to get with Luke before he leaves the company.  A plan of action is called for and the girls devise the plan.Gia will do a quick makeover so no one will recognize her and she will seduce Luke while he is in Las Vegas.  All goes according to plan Gia seduces Luke as Vanna and she gets her man.  They are both enjoying the benefits of the seduction until they both start having real feelings for each other.  Gia flees before Luke awakens.  Luke is hurting after she bailed as he thought they had something special.When Gia returns to work she is promoted and is now working under Luke.  Terrified that Luke will recognize her she telecommutes and finally just backs out of the project.  Luke figures out Vanna is really Gia and is furious until overhearing gossip about someone who was sleeping with someone else and was let go.Gia is escorted to Luke's office when she realizes he knows about Vanna and he decides a little sweet revenge is in order.  Now if they could just make this work.***ARC provided by author in exchange for an honest review***One of my favorite parts:He's hot enough to melt chocolate, Gia said, imagining just that, then wishing she could lick it off his naked body afterwards.

I mean, what is there not to love about a college freshman virgin from the sticks and a male player reforming his ways?? Truly nothing. And a Disney theme to boot?? Yes please!!Clearly this book had some of my favorite themes and it delivered in a big way. I was needed something light to pick me up and this good old-fashioned M/M sappy romance did the trick! Very sweet, very slow-burn (which is a WIN for me), Love Lessons was all that I hoped it would be.Now, it wasn't perfect. I had some issues with the pacing (it dragged towards the middle and the end) and I grew a little bored of the college campus politics. I also ended up comparing it to two of my FAVORITES from last December, Christmas Kitsch (which I praise far and wide, like it's my job) and Blame It On The Mistletoe (which was nearly perfect for me as well and with no pacing flaws). However, while this won't make my favorite's list, Love Lessons certainly deserves to stand tall and proud in the same field as those two other juggernauts.I'd recommend this book for someone looking for a lovely NA read with a long buildup to sex and plenty of relationship development.

Aliens living in outer space capturing women in a Hunt and bringing them back to their space ships to live out their wildest sexual cravings...Yep, total guilty fun!Menace has worked hard being a warrior and has earned enough points to participate in the Hunt, an event where he can capture a woman and bring her back to live with him forever. Naya's only participating in the Hunt because she's keeping a promise she made to her best friend. Unfortunately, her best friend is able to escape but Naya is grabbed by Menace.Even as Naya remains scared of what will happen to her, Menace begins breaking down her walls and pulling her into an erotic relationship where all her secret fantasies are possible. He is able to bring out her submissive nature and gives her pleasure like she has never known. Unfortunately, Naya has secrets from her past that threaten to destroy both her and Menace.At 192 pages, Caught by Menace is a quick read. While book two can certainly be read as a stand-alone book I recommend reading book one if possible as some of the characters and events in book two are from book one. With a little bondage, a sweet bossy alien, and a meacutenage scene, Caught by Menace is definitely guilty fun. I will wait to see what the third book in the series will bring.

591216,B00E1IAQWE,"[22, 23]",5,"Ceri London has written, in Shimmer In The Dark: Rogue Genesis one of the most powerful science fiction novels I have read since Dune. Well, actually, it is better than Dune. More creative, with a wider range and depth of reality, that is approachable to all readers. This is, without doubt, a science fiction novel, but it also has strong ties to military-political intrigue in the present day which grounds the novel in a level of believability even when the fiction portion of the science asks you to stretch your mind into new levels of belief. Some, I suppose, would lean more towards calling it `fantasy' as there are no space ships and Earth colonies on other planets. If you are one of the `hard sci-fi geeks' that some of my friends are you might be disappointed by no space rockets blasting around, I suppose, but that should in no way deter you from reading this jewel of a book.Unlike many, and especially one of the reviewers of the book, I have no problem stretching credulity to new levels. I don't expect a science fiction or fantasy book to stay within the realm of `probability'. I expect to be taken to a new place, a new level of existence, while I expect that existence to still feel believable. I expect to be charmed into a new sense of reality for a short while. Something that Ms. London has done brilliantly in this, the first of a four-part series.Niall Kearey is a very special person, with a very special family. As has been described by the blurb on the book, he can, with is mind, reach out across galaxies to what he thinks is a `dream world' - a world racing towards annihilation - a world soon to align with Earth, with unknown outcome. Here on Earth, there are power-brokers and politicians, secret societies, power-hungry and amoral politicians, and a corrupt U.S. Military. A military and power structure that will do anything, including the destruction of Niall's beloved family, to bring him under their control and use him for world domination. Of this, and possibly other worlds . . .London, in my estimation, did a beautiful job of making me feel her characters. I actually understood, and admired, Niall. My admiration was not only for his special abilities, but also for his love of and deep commitment to his family. In the face of horrific circumstances, he stands by his family and continues to fight for them, when everyone around him is betraying his faith, his honour and his commitment to country. The very thing that Niall has fought for, and watched his friends die for, is pulled into the light, and that light shines upon a dark and venomous snarl of greed and xenophobia that would happily watch whole civilizations die, accepting only the technology and power that those cultures might provide. In all, humanity at it's slimiest, humanity who would sentence millions to death, while gobbling up their scientist to live as virtual prisoners, slaves to the military-industrial complex. Yep. Humans all right. Humans who would imprison a decorated military man under correct supervision, using him as a lab rat to assure his asset to this nation status.Yes, a lot of the book made me sick. But sick in that everything that London writes is so very gut-wrenchingly believable in so many ways. So real within the fiction that she creates. Amidst the black holes, space-time jumps, dark matter universes and other fascinating and well researched portions of the book, London delves into the human psyche, and lays bare its soul. And proves, beyond a doubt, the very reasons that, for so many reasons, even if there are other civilizations out there, my view of how they would view us is That trailer trash planet of vicious, dangerous creatures.  I can see the signs hanging in space now - Danger!! Do not approach third planet from Sol! Local inhabitants RABID!!!! Do not pass within fifty billion klicks!!!!Overall, if you are a lover of science fiction style fantasy, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It was on my back burner for a while, a lot longer than I had wished for it to be, but I am so very glad that I finally sat down and read it. It was well worth the time. More than worth it. This book needs a lot more attention than it is getting right now. Go out and buy it. I can guarantee you that you will be recommending it to your friends. It's very creativity of concept makes it a standout in the field. That should draw you in. What will keep you there is the writing, the characterizations, and her deep understanding of the human psyche will keep you reading, and watching for the next in the series.Highly recommended.","07 21, 2013",A1WRXACOKPITBQ,"Leiah So, I Read This Book Today . . .",Breathtaking,1374364800,0.9565217391304348,True,5.0

Could it have been something like that ?, one ponders.One fault, imho, that should be avoided ( and which is recurrent in the genre nowadays ) is the antropomorphization of things. Why should the machinery on board the starcraft contain Computers?

I have to admit by about page 2, I was going to stop reading.  This book came off as being coarse, perverse, and juvenile.  However, I realized that it wasn't the story or the writing that made it those things.  Rather, it was the character Bob, himself.  He was rough, reckless, and raging with hormones.Of course.He's a teenaged boy.  Aren't they all like that?  The portrayal of Bob is stunningly accurate in that respect (well, at least of what 16 year old boys are like in my head).  It was such an aha moment for me that it's what made me continue reading.The story follows Bob on his fantastic journey across the universe, fighting evil along with his sidekick, sex kitten of a girlfriend who's always at the ready.  So, if you like mad scientists, aliens, superpowers, and sex, you'll probably like this book.  You should be aware that this book contains graphic situations sprinkled with sailor-like language.

Re-discovering fragments of herself, she sets out to search for the secret of a beautiful embroidered cabinet which is on display in her hotel. Her curiosity is encouraged by the deepening friendship with her childhood friend, Donal, who has remained on the island, and who is the guardian of the curiosity cabinet's secrets.Three hundred years earlier, Henrietta Dalrymple is forcibly removed from her life in Edinburgh, a life she shares with her baby son, but when she is kidnapped and held against her will on Garve she finds life on the small island totally abhorrent. Her captor is Manus McNeil, Laird of the isle and a highlander to boot, fearsome, devilish and ultimately controlling. Henrietta is lost and alone but takes comfort in small friendships, as gradually the relationship between captor and captive becomes something more meaningful.Beautifully written, this dual time romance captures time and place completely. The interwoven love stories blend together quite seamlessly, both strands of the story are equally appealing, neither one outshining the other. The spirit of Garve is captured perfectly, the imagery is so unique, you may find yourself gasping as you see wild swans fly across the sky, and the tang of seaweed, and the hint of a sea breeze remain with you as you turn each page.The skill of this talented story teller is present in every word, she weaves a kind of magic, and makes beautiful pictures in your mind.","02 9, 2012",AXH6PFYIFGIXG,jaffareadstoo,Beautiful romance...,1328745600,0.8571428571428571,True,5.0

This seems odd given her close relationship with her loving father, especially since he was in the best position to help her with it.The dialogue between Nate and Grace is often stilted.  The ending is unnecessarily rushed when the two main characters make huge turnarounds.  Grace doesn't even want to have sex in Nate's bed for the first few weeks because it would mean the relationship was too serious.  By week five (with one or two encounters per week) she is talking about love.Grace's refusal to conceded that Nate's abilities as a medium are real, even after he shocks her with information no one but her dead father could know is disappointing.

464892,B00BUFR5V6,"[0, 0]",3,"Title:  Wild ChildSeries:  N/AAuthor:  Shelley MunroGenre:  Erotica, RomanceBlurb:  Zoe Underwood is one sexy disruption.From the moment her father married Matt's mother, Zoe has tempted Matt Cantrell with her seductive curves and driven him crazy with her flirting and provocative manner. The thing is they have no future because Zoe is his stepsister. Determined to dodge trouble, Matt leaves Auckland to live and work in the Gold Coast of Australia. A sea between them should do the trick and let him move forward without the Zoe distraction in his life.Matt Cantrell is one stubborn dude.No one presses Zoe's buttons like the tall, dark and gorgeous Matt. In fact, every other man pales in comparison. One last play. Zoe decides to invade Matt's territory and make her move before some other clever woman snaps him up. She'll bust through emotional walls and push boundaries. By the time she's finished, Matt won't know what hit him. Yes. Good or bad, she'll stir things up and take a chance on love.Thoughts:  When Matt Cantrell comes home to find clothes strewn down the hallway leading to his bed, he thinks it's his girlfriend who has come to make up with him after a fight.  Little does he know that it's his tempting step-sister who has ditched everything in an effort to come and win him for her own!  Zoe has made a decision to come see Matt - minus their parents - hoping he will cave into their desire for each other if he doesn't their parents to use as a buffer against her.  She hopes that if he has to face her one-on-one, he won't be able to resist their mutual desire.  It doesn't take Matt long to cave in to Zoe's wiles, but neither figured on the girlfriend Miranda prowling around looking to re-claim her man!The sparks were really flying between Zoe and Matt, and I really enjoyed their chemistry with one another.  The story was well-written and you really felt a connection with the characters.  Zoe was fun, flirty, and I really enjoyed how she pushed Matt's buttons in her attempts to push him over the edge of that step-sister/step-brother line that he had drawn in the sand.  Matt wasn't really able to resist her very hard, which I guess explains why he felt the need to move so far away from the family!  I was thrilled when he finally caved in!  And they still had the family to deal with, as well as the supposed girlfriend to add the necessary conflict to the story.As much as I enjoyed the story, there are a few drawbacks.  Most obviously, of course, is the length.  I felt the story would have been better served if it had been longer.  It seemed almost like you were coming into the middle of the book - you were missing the build-up at the beginning.  I would have enjoyed perhaps a prologue where you have them first coming together as a family and them recognizing their desire for each other and/or some beginning scenes where we see their frustration throughout the teenage years at not being able to act out on this forbidden desire.  The end also seemed a little abrupt- I found myself looking to make sure it really was the end.  There was nothing wrong with it, it just seemed like there should be more.And while I felt the desire and attraction between the two characters, I didn't really feel the love part of their connection.  Upon saying that, I do feel like the love was there, but due to length we just really couldn't quite grasp it completely.  Although, I think being able to make that connection was important to the story because obviously they would not be willing to risk breaking up their entire family for just a one-night stand or a sexcapade.  I think if it had been more drawn out I would have enjoyed it so much more!

Don8217t get me wrong, there is plenty of smut in there for you, but that wasn8217t the only thing that was happening throughout the book.Pandora8217s character, I almost felt sorry for her to an extent because of what she had been though in her life.

To me, with her character it just felt like she was playing a game with everyone hoping to win.Jax8217s character, I felt sorry for him in the beginning of the story (when you read you will understand why that is) but as the story progressed, I started to not like him at all.  I thought that he turned from a really great guy to a complete jerk.The story is short yes, but at the same time there was a lot of information given to you and you were left wondering what was going to happen next.  I think that the author could have extended the story just a bit so that we could have found out what was going to happen to the couple.

I sort of just jumped into it. I have to say that I was immediately hooked after reading the first couple of pages. I really enjoyed it, but there were some parts that threw me off and had me annoyed at times, but I will get into that in a bit.When Mara's mother dies she is sent off to live with her father who is a complete stranger to her. She knows nothing about him or what he is really like. Only what her mother shared with her, and even that wasn't much. From the first two pages of the story I was already interested and wanted to know what was going to happen. The minute Mara arrives, she quickly learns that there is a huge mystery to the town and there's obviously something she doesn't know and no one is willing to share with her. Already half the town dislikes her and she has no clue. They look down on her and her family. The only friends she makes and that her father has are also disliked. With everything she is going through, losing her mother, moving in with a stranger, new town, new friends, that last thing she needs is enemies. Then she meets Josh, one of the cool kids and they quickly build a friendship, only it's a secret friendship. It was just a lot of bad happening to her and if it were me, I would have had a break down.Mara started off as a strong character with a slick mouth and always spoke what was on her mind. She defended herself and she even defended those who weren't really her friends. She just couldn't stand bullying. I loved this about her, but then there were times where she would just annoy me. I understand the bitterness towards her father and the pain she is feeling, but at times she lashed out and it just bothered me a bit and felt unnecessary. Another thing that annoyed me a bit was that half the book, or a little more than half, it's a whole bunch of, You're not ready to know the truth or It's not my place to tell you. After a while I got tired of everyone telling her this and I wanted to know the truth already. Once Mara does finally learn the truth and everything is revealed, the story got even more interesting. I also really liked the relationship Mara had with her friends, and the one she developed with Josh. If there is a second part to Surfacing, I would definitely like to read it. I enjoyed it, but I just wish Mara's personality stayed consistent. She was up and down for me. There were also lots of moments that took me by surprise.

We are introduced to Evan Loehr and Claire Montoya. I could not put this novel down once I started reading it, This author give us a realistic look on the military and even a relationship between to emotional and very wounded people where we see that both have demons that they hadto deal with but often seemed to compliment each other as they are forced to work together to train a combat team. This author did a wonderful job at making you feel just what Evan and Claire were going through. You are able to taste their frustrations, feel their fears and insecurities from their own personal lives. This read was very enjoyable...yet heavy at times but had the right amount to humor to lighten it up a bit.I found this story with a good plot and the characters were all likable and with this novel Until There Was You you have a well written novel that I would definitely recommend to you.","04 21, 2013",A3K3P9U2AB4P4R,"Arlena Tell us about yourself!

258712,B008IU9SSE,"[1, 1]",4,"3.5 starsEvan Loehr is a West Point trained officer who plays by the rules.  Claire Montoya was an enlisted who went to officer school and never met a rule that couldn't at least be bent.  After arguing their way through deployment in Iraq, can Captain America and Captain Most Likely to Screw Up call a truce and accomplish their current Hail Mary mission training unprepared troops for deployment to a war zone?One of the most appealing aspects of UNTIL THERE WAS YOU is the realism. No flights of fancy or MacGyverish exploits, just the reality of two people serving in the military.  Two soldiers who've made it their lives and their family because it was all they had, until now.I think UNTIL THERE WAS YOU is the perfect balance of love and reality. Taking into consideration the characters and their profession, hearts, flowers, rainbows  unicorns would never appeal to Claire.  Someone who sees HER, scars, foibles, and all the ugliness she feels makes her somehow less a person and unworthy to truly see that and still want to be with her, that's love.  Claire's non-verbal communication that Evan is so adept at reading is a barrier that speaks volumes about Claire.  Evan is more open and willing than Claire belying her anal retentive a****** characterization of him.  Claire's the runner not Evan.  I like that.  Ms. Scott has all the army life aspects down, as expected, but UNTIL THERE WAS YOU is also highly emotional.  I don't mean drama queen emotion.  This is painful gut wrenching emotion.  Evan and Claire's progression from antagonistic to potential lover's forces each of them to face demons they've tried to keep buried.There are some memorable secondary characters but the one who stood out and I hope most to see again is Sgt. Reza Iaconelli, Claire's best friend.UNTIL THERE WAS YOU isn't a romanticized love story, it's a love story you can truly envision happening. A real day in/day out love we can all aspire to.  If that's the kind of love story you're looking for you won't want to miss UNTIL THERE WAS YOU.Reviewed by IvyD for Manic Readers","10 8, 2012",A380RZCQTDKSH7,Ivy,Realistic Love,1349654400,1.0,True,4.0

They've been having a relationship for a while now, but it was one of those don't ask don't tell type of things. But Zara knows she's in love with him, and that he's never going to give her more. So she decides to try to move on with someone else.However, three years later. Everything has changed. Zara just divorced a man, now she calls Ham to make sure he's okay after hearing some disturbing news, but things seem to go bad after that.Ham, he's led his life the way he has to keep from being hurt by a woman. What he didn't realize was how much he screwed up by letting Zara go, and walking away from her. Now after some things happened to him, he's decided to set up home in her town. Because he wants her back, now and forever he wants her. But with all of the things going on in Zara's life not to mention all the drama that is going to come from her family things get hard while they are trying to figure out their relationship.Wow, okay I liked the book. I will start off with that, I did like it. But I just couldn't connect with the characters, mainly Ham. I really couldn't stand him at all. I thought he was a selfish, womanizing jerk. There was just something about him that rubbed me the wrong way. And that is horrible considering when I read about him in The Burg series I actually liked him. Now I felt like he was a major disappointment. He said so many hurtful things to Zara, and I felt like he never really redeemed himself for it. Some of those things he said cut even me deeply, and I'm not even a part of it. But I admired how strong Zara was. She let everything go once she had it out. I loved that about her. And the fact that she could deal with Ham leaving so much, and still love him.Also the book didn't seem to have a major drama point. I mean like yeah it had drama, but no one got kidnapped, shot at, stabbed, or buried alive so I was sort of disappointed. Especially with this series, someone always seems to get hurt. This kills me to have such a mediocre response to a KA book. I mean seriously, I feel like I've let my favorite author down some how. But I just couldn't bring myself to more than just like the book. The writing was as good as any other KA book, and of course it was awesome to see more of Nina, and Max.

I felt that Kristen dealt with those issues between the characters with her style and her way of writing that I happen to love.  I missed the detailed descriptions she is so famous for.

371851,B00AJVE1FK,"[0, 0]",4,"*DISCLAIMER* I received a free promo copy in exchange for an honest review.*It was a quick, easy read. The writing was crisp with almost no grammatical errors, the point-of-view was fairly consistent, with it slipping only once or twice, and the characters were very well written.Unfortunately, the start was a bit slow. The story opens with Abby in a crappy room, looking out the window, remembering the accident that changed her life. Personally, I think it would've been more engaging had the author wrote the accident as a prologue or even let the reader experience it through a dream or flashback sequence. I was happy when the pace picked up shortly after this scene.The action sequence near the end of the story was great! It was easy to understand what was happening without being bogged down with unnecessary descriptions and actions. I felt the tension, excitement, and fear that the characters were feeling.I only had one issue with this story: the romance between Abby and Matt. It felt rushed and a bit unbelievable. Abby meets Matt, he drives her to a Christmas party, helps her with a task that she's embarrassed to need help with, he drives her home, they get attacked, he saves her life and then they fall into bed together. Really? First of all, the story is set in 1866 London. How often did a lady sleep with a man she'd just me? (Unless she was a professional, of course.) Not only does it seem to contradict what was acceptable during the times, it makes the heroine seem sleazy and unlikeable. Abby's grateful that Matt saved her life and that he accepted her for what she was. Based on this line of thinking it makes me wonder, will Abby sleep with any man who exhibits these two qualities?At less than 30 pages in length and with the way it ended I was a bit disappointed. Maybe disappointed isn't the right word....confused. Why stop now? Why not just combine all the parts into one longer piece of work? And why is this being called book one when it read much more like a prequel?Overall it was a good story, a good start to a new, exciting series and well worth the time it took to read it.","12 16, 2012",A1WBOEL8Z90I4U,Kara Leigh Miller,"Intriguing story, but much too short.",1355616000,0.0,False,4.0

But let me start with the good news: this is a well-crafted story, one of the better urban fantasy/paranormals I've read lately. Well-edited (yay!), adequately laid plot, and male and female protagonists I could really get behind ... at the beginning. Their backstories were handled with aplomb, moving the plot along and including only that which was necessary.Now, the problem I had was later in the book: the characters, particularly Dante, become caricatures and really pushed my suspension of disbelief. Jace is a woman in a man's world, a cop, having fought through and past her personal demons and upbringing, on the cusp of success. When she encounters Dante her personality changes from determined, self-sufficient to obsessive and needy, barely able to stave off the forces compelling her submission. Dante comes across as rigid, unyielding, controlling and one-dimensional. The antagonists (especially Markos) were often inserted in such a way that it was difficult to distinguish one from the other. Dante's and Jace's attraction was largely consummated with `fireworks' and strange `feelings' (very paranormal-ish, but real human emotions and physical responses would have actually made this more sensual). And the ending was disappointing in that Jace actually capitulates to the paranormal `draw' of Dante, forsaking her commitment to her career. Of the minor characters, Dante's sister Cassie was true-to-life as a headstrong teenager but Jace's brother Jimmy seemed more a contrivance than anything else. I like growth and change in characters: for Dante - none, and Jace - wrong direction.Obviously my reaction to the characters is something that I own, an opinion, and others may not feel the same. It's still a good read. But because of my issues with the characters I can only give it 3 stars.","06 24, 2012",A6GB4U6PZA3VF,Beach Bum Books,Good paranormal read,1340496000,1.0,True,3.0

What I found out about these people--yes I said people, they were more like people I knew rather than characters in a book--blew my mind. Although they were both severely bent, they were not broken, and with patience, love and determination, they show the payoff is worth every sacrifice and the some.Portia, who was literally discarded by her family, turned to her two friends, Tarry and Niki, for all her emotional needs. The three lived spoiled lives of fame and too much money, which only got them in trouble.Will had a hard childhood, full of abuse and pain, until he met his new `family' and with the strength of that family, and God, he grew strong and left his past behind him.It was Will's strength and love that Portia needed to take her out of her unhappy place and right into his arms.

I believe it is one I will be reading again and again.Candy Bryce wins a prize from a local radio station a date with a celebrity. She believes she isn't someone that Dave Roads, the sexy lead singer from a hot band, would be at all interested in but she figures she won the dinner she may as well go and have a good time. To prepare herself she listens to the songs his band is famous for, gets dressed, and takes a leap of faith that she will not look too foolish.Dave Roads is a sexy, rich, oh so yummy celeb fulfilling an obligatory roll as a dinner date for a random radio station caller. Comfortable with himself he figures this is just one more publicity stunt but he may as well enjoy it. He figures they will eat, talk and go their separate ways.As dinner progresses the chemistry starts to sizzle. Dave is no longer filling a role he is actually feeling like this is a real date. Candy is making him feel something he hasn't felt in a very long time, so he decides that he is off the clock and this is a genuine date. The night progresses and Dave rolls with it by asking Candy back to his place for dessert. Candy is having a hard time believing her good fortune but decides to ride this out and see where it ends. And the ending is definitely worth the ride!Favorite Quote: Dave had been thinking about all the things he wanted to do to Candy for the past two days. Now he was going to have her all to himself--and once he had her securely bound, he could take his time doing whatever he could think of to bring her pleasure.Review by PattiBook provided by PublisherReview Originally Posted @ Romancing the Book.","07 26, 2013",A26J2TRDPZH7RZ,Romancing the Book,One Hot Read,1374796800,1.0,True,3.222222222222222

Sometimes when you read a lot the characters from one book seem to reappear in every other book you read because the same traits are used by writers over and over again. Thankfully, that is not the case here. The main characters are unique and are far from recycled stereotypes. The storyline was also really creative. The author credibly dealt with agoraphobia, alcoholism and the criminal justice system in a way that felt natural and optimistic. Despite the heavy topics, this was not a depressing read.

I found some aspects highly creative while others made the reading a bit difficult. There were some editing errors, which for the most part, I was able to overlook. There also were numerous grammatical errors, which unfortunately, I found it more difficult to see beyond. I fully understand that dialogue is intended to portray how people speak in real life and so grammar may easily be--and indeed often ought to be--brushed aside in that regard. However, the prose itself flows so much more smoothly when things are in order and I found that that was, all too often, not the case. Thus, some portion of my review is attributable to the same.DARK GENESIS tells the story of Alyssa, who awakens in a world unknown to her and with no recollection of her past. The world is an alternate reality where a wide variety of creatures are found: witches, vampires, werewolves, and more. In this regard, it is rather like TOY STORY in that in TOY STORY all of the possible different kinds of toys come together. In DARK GENESIS, all the different kinds of creatures are found. Just when I would think we'd been introduced to all the various types possible, another would pop up--this time a teleporter--now a Frankenstein--now a herbalist/healer--and so on.Alyssa discovers when she destroys certain marked people/creatures, that some portion of her memories come back to her. This storyline concept was quite creative. However, I found that after about the first 30% of the story, there was a bit too much more of the same: find the bad guy, escape from the bad guy, return to the bad guy, and ultimately, destroy the bad guy. Thus, for me the story could have been fairly sufficiently trimmed down.My primary issue with DARK GENESIS, was that I was never certain if it was supposed to be a dark story or a comedy and I was never convinced that Alyssa was who or what she was said to be. Of course, this was a fantasy story and so, all things are open and possible. However, the real life portions of the story--those things that show the vast differences between the worlds at play--were unconvincing. Specifically, a 17 year old CIA agent. (Hmmmm.) Further, while the dialogue was at times funny and cryptic, it also left me with an image of Alyssa as something more like a 12 year old than a 17 year old. Thus, I found it difficult when Alyssa engaged in more adult behavior.All in all, DARK GENESIS was interesting, but did not leave me longing to return to it or begging for the next installment.","04 27, 2013",A23QBI7AY6G0OB,Patricia Reding,Alternate World,1367020800,0.0,False,3.0

The pair don't seem to have very much in common. They didn't even make each other laugh, somehow they just got along.As the trail heats up, Laurent decides to send Coren back to their pad in Chamonix for her own safety. But when he vanishes from contact, virtually penniless Coren shows herself to be unexpectedly resourceful as she sets off to find him in Liguria.

560857,B00DJB6KE2,"[0, 0]",4,"4.5 out of 5 stars...Stripped begins with the introduction of Grey Amundesn, a pastor's daughter, living in small town Macon Georgia.  She's an only child whose lived a strict life under the very watchful eye of her father, who believes everything most teenagers would consider fun a sin.  Grey feels as though her father doesn't understand anything about her and if it weren't for the close bond with her mother would feel very much alone.Grey's passion is dance, it makes her feel alive, allows her to express herself in a freeing way and is something she excels at.  While her father wasn't originally on board with her mother's help he has agreed to allow the activity as long as her dances are appropriate and her costumes respective, nothing seductive will be tolerated.  Honestly, up to this point all I could think of were the similarities to Footloose, which I didn't mind because I LOVE that movie!  Her dance classes open the doors to friendships, which eventually exposes Grey to parties and boys, however throughout it all Grey never does anything her father would consider compromising.As time progresses Grey begins to develop an interest in film, not acting but creating and producing.  She desperately wants to attend a film school in California but of course her father won't allow her to go (in his mind she needs to meet a nice Christian guy who plans to pastor a church, get married and become a pastor's wife).  Again, with her mother's help she applies and not only gets accepted but also earns a scholarship to pay the way.  While she is joyous she's found a way to go tragedy strikes the Amundesn family ripping Grey and her father apart.  Without his blessing, help or money Grey packs up to follow her dreams in California.As you can imagine life in California isn't easy and the $400 she left with doesn't stretch very far.  Determined to make it on her on Grey searches for part-time employment, however without any job experience Grey continues to find herself unemployed.  With deadlines approaching and bills to pay the only job she can find is as a stripper!  Let the fun and story officially begin!We both really loved this book and found ourselves easily relating with Grey.  We think it's because both of us were born and raised in the south in southern Baptist homes, which we are proud of, but which also gives us first hand experience as to what Grey's life was like and could easily relate with how she felt.  When you grow up in the Bible belt, you can certainly plan on experiencing judgmental people and let us tell you, Jasinda Wilder completely nailed the descriptions of Grey's experiences and reactions.  We can promise that if we were ever forced to strip for a living, we would probably die of humiliation and throw up every night as well.This story was full of characters we could relate to and there will be some you find yourself hating and some whom you won't be able to help but love.  We found ourselves laughing, crying and struggling right along with Grey as she dealt with guilt, shame and then felt complete when she eventually found herself and allowed herself the happiness she deserved.As previously mentioned Grey's father is a southern Baptist preacher and is ultra strict.  He has ingrained it in Grey's mind that anything fun is of the devil and is a sin.  It's a shame some people believe that to be true, and believe me there people who feel this way.  However, we found ourselves irritated with him because it's as though he never listens to Grey, never wants to compromise, it's as though he's forgotten his first role to her isn't pastor but father.  By the end of the book we're happy to say he redeemed himself some.  On the other hand Grey's mom was such a lovable character, very sweet, super supportive and silently strong.  We can only hope to be that good of a mother to our own daughters.  What a great example of a mother and certainly a great addition to the book.Now let's talk about the book's main man...Dawson Kellor, let the swooning begin!  He has to be one of the top book boyfriends of all time, he's just fabulous!  He always puts Grey above himself and just wants to make her happy.  Let me tell you, Dawson absolutely backs up all his words and promises with some serious actions.  He is strong, intuitive, sensitive, really he's the whole package.  And it doesn't hurt he's a top Hollywood actor whose just landed the role of Rhett Butler in a remake of Gone with the wind (the best movie of all time and a true southern classic!  Yeah, that definitely made us love him even more.  What girl could ever resist Rhett Butler?).  Those things aside what further continued our love affair with Dawson is that he encourages Grey to open her eyes, answer questions for herself, form her own opinion, embrace her past.  It also didn't hurt getting to read in great detail about some of those eye opening experiences, they were intense and yep I'm going to say it they were pretty darn hot as well!Don't worry, you won't be disappointed, this book is filled with lots of smut, however, that's not what makes it such a good read.  It's a great book because the story is just so good and because Dawson and Grey make a really great couple.  While some may find this book and story line predictable it was a really fun journey and one we really are glad we took a chance on.  There wasn't a lot of unnecessary drama in Stripped, but we are okay with that.  Not all books need to throw curve balls at you to be good.

I read Whiskey Dreams and was so enthralled in Brom and John's story, I had to grab Haunted Passions immediately.  I loved that Rose took this classic tale and made it her own, right down to the Headless Horseman's motivations.A spooky little love triangle, with a twist, all three participants are willing and able!  The intimacy between characters as well as plot and story are clearly defined and captivating Rose has a knack for attention to detail, right down to that pesky blade of grass.In the sequel to Whiskey Dreams, Rose takes the forbidden relationship between Brom and John a step further with the addition of Katrina Van Tassel.  Brom is unabashadly in love with John Crane. The sexy, if a bit naive, school teacher. He's also in love with the equally sexy and naive Katrina Van Tassel, Sleepy Hollow's most eligible Mistress. When Brom and Katrina announce their engagement, John is all but destroyed and despondent. In a moment of weakness, he does something unthinkable, something that sets him right into the Headless Horseman's sight!Not only do we get lots of page time with the force of nature that is Brom and John when these two get tangled up together, but Rose add's Katrina to the mix. Creating one of the sexiest threesomes ever written! Just as this unlikely threesome are trying to work out the kinks in their would be relationship, the Horseman makes his move.  When John figures out exactly what, or whom he is after, he will stop at nothing to protect the people he loves.I'd call this an Erotic tale that is sensual, intriguing, mysterious and Romantic above all it's a fascinating Love story. Rose reinvents this story and gives it a breath of fresh air with the love triangle and her murderous ghostly version of the Headless Horseman. Warning there are so extremely erotic scenes between Brom and John as well as Brom, John and Katrina that were so steamy, I thought my kindle would catch on fire!I give this one 4/5 but, that's just my two cents!","08 26, 2012",AVY8JRFPVWQ1I,"Tams Avid reader, reviewer, blogger and budd...",Sexy little twist on the Sleepy Hollow classic!,1345939200,0.5,True,4.0

The book is heavy read in parts and contains minor typos (sixth moth of my pregnancy should read sixth month of my pregnancy Bad sings should read Bad signs).

I have to be honest the cover was what caught my eyes as I was browsing the Samhain website.  The cover art is pretty!Ciara Liung has basically been a hermit her whole life because of her physic abilities.  She has this awesome collection of movies and a TV system set that is any man's wet dream to help her exist the hermit life!  She helps locate missing jewelries for the FBI through Karmic Consultants.  For her skills to work properly she has to get nekki in a pool, bath or tank of water for her vision to come to her clearly of where the missing jewels are.  I like Ciara shes spunky and no nonsense.  She's like Lucy Liu's character in the Charlie Angels movie.  Come to the think of it the hero even says she looks like Lucy Liu.Nate Smith is sexy and broody.  I like broody boys.  Makes me want to tickle them to get them to laugh! He's upset that he's been laid up after being shot at.  He's basically a desk jockey right now.  He's Ciara new handler for the FBI since her previous handler recently retired.  Nate basically doesn't believe that Ciara has the psychic powers.  He's going to prove to his bosses that he can still useful and is more than a babysitter by getting Ciara to admit she helps with the theft of these missing jewels.  The cat and mouse games ensue from there for these two.  I really liked the beginning of the book.  The lead couple had chemistry and I was looking forward to their little battles.  The middle of the book for me was weak.  I thought the sequence of events were a bit disjointed and didn't flow very well.  It felt like it just popped from one scene to another real fast and didn't hold my interest much.  I found myself skimming a bit.  The ending was cute though.Overall though I still enjoyed my first time with Vivi.  Even though this was the 4th book I was still able to follow the story.

I can8217t tell you our exact argument because it would involve a massive spoiler. However, just know that I am right and she is wrong. So there.Seriously, though. I found Harper realistic and believable. I wish she had handled things differently, but I didn8217t find her reaction out of character for her. When she8217s freaked, she runs. Deacon is strong and stoic. That8217s just how they are. But that8217s really all I can say about that w/o getting into spoilerific details.

I might, maybe, occasionally get drunk and rowdy too, so I loved it. I would definitely hang out with Harper and have a great time.I  also loved that Harper went to Jazz when she needed to really talk. It made them seem more like family.

I prefer stand alone tales (even in shorts and prequels) and this one ends on a holding breath cliffhanger wherein one gets a glimpse of what lies in full.  I did not reduce any stars for such and most will not be bothered by ending as they will finish the story when they get the full.In this short we are introduced to our protag (hero or main character) at time he is captive within a terrorist camp.  He is Canadian Intelligence on a hostage recovery mission at time of his capture.  This is his first person narrative relating his experiences while in terrorist hold.  His voice (dialogue and thoughts) come across as very realistic and apt within scenes.  His goal is to continue mission of hostage rescue (he has no clue due to captivity) if necessary by obtaining his own freedom by force or by finesse.It is well told and a good advert for the novel.Christine","08 8, 2012",A30YDY4XKVUBUY,Christine Staeven,carved in memory,1344384000,1.0,True,4.0

Book 2 and 3 SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMBINED they are so short!!!Where to start?  This one is much shorter, about half what the first one  was and, I have to be honest, reads more like a novella.  Book One had so many fun characters and things going on that it was a can't put down read.  Book Two was a little redundant in the middle with the relaying of information to different characters, that I found myself skimming.  Also, it is so OBVIOUS who the bad guy is that it is a little frustrating to see the baffled head shaking and suspecting of friends.  And what happened to Harrison's man-card?  He just kept saying, Whatever you think is best we'll do it your way.  He was super sexy and dominant in Book One not so much in this book.  It was Siena's story. I see that Book Three, is out which is also much shorter making it logical to have combined Two and Three and made it a more dynamic story.Siena is afraid to tell her Father and brother about Harrison after he beats Enzo in Book One and she gets the blackmail photos.  She knows she could be exposed at any moment, so she and Harrison decide to take a break for two weeks until the next race.  There is never any drama of cheating or insecurities, just the drama of who is blackmailing Siena and what she should do about it.  She doesn't want to live without Harrison, but she also doesn't want to burden her family with the situation.  When Siena's best friend Bex points out the obvious - that it would be better if she told her family rather than have the pictures come to light as a surprise, I thought Siena was going to man-up.I hate that I didn't like this one as much as the first one, but it just didn't have the FUN clandestine love affair going for it or the smart and sexy repartee between Harrison and Sienna.  This one was filled with too much angst about being found out (when there was an obvious solution), anger and meanness from Enzo towards Siena and depressing news about their father's health.  While reading book 2 is necessary to keep up with the series, I repeat myself in saying, Colleen Masters should have put books two and three together which would have made a more compelling STORY, not a novella.There was some editing issues with some missing words and wrong words being used.

Who knew that was even possible. A true writer and reader will have great admiration for Ms. Eubanks. I love...simply love how she stirs in love and chemistry between her characters. It's like you feel the connection happening. It's intense and while it is brewing you can literally feel a smile creep up on your lips as the meet and leave to meet again. I am not sure if it is the romantic in me or the young teenage girl who prayed for the pursuit of young men like Chase and Quinn. Either way it is refreshing to want it more as an adult as if this person still exists whether you are straight or gay. At 42 years old and just coming out of a 12 year relationship it almost brings some hope that the high strung Quinn and Stacey begin to play with in the beginning is out there in the world waiting for you. She is crafty in how she builds the person physically and emotionally with bits and pieces of traits and trails of thoughts until the person is in fruition. She doesn't over describe her male character she lets out words that allow you to see through her pen. It was like I was looking through Stacey's eyes seeing the handsomeness of Quinn then looking through the big brown eyes of Quinn seeing this gentle, yet feisty tender roni looking into the glossiness in her eyes as he mesmerizes her. Perfection! And this is only the beginning but you know that whatever is in the cards for Quinn and Stacey its going to be crazy because their connection will be impossible to break and whosoever tries to do so will bring drama and that's all that is needed for a 5 star read.The more I read on I realize that Sabrina's strength is in building relationships and emotions in her characters. It didn't take a lot of wordiness to feel what type of person Fitz was envious and how Lonzo was the loyalty between the trio's friendships. From the time their friendships and characters were being built you knew that there was going to be a test in their closeness that Fitz's envy for Quinn would be tested, and Lonzo's loyalty would be tested. Being the family man that Lonzo was innuendos of Lonzo's demise is hidden in the words. It kept me curious and eager to read on.Note: This read had me saying so many OMG's, No!!!'s, Don't'!'s , That's sooo crazy!'s, Why'd he do that?'s, that there was no way that after completing this read that Sabrina would not receive a 5 STAR review for Boosters.At any point during a book where the characters feel real and you truly feel like you are reading one of their diaries then the writer has done a tremendous job! And each time I read a book by Ms. Eubanks my vocabulary grows...how refreshing is that? Sabrina has taken Urban Fiction to another level with Boosters.....bravo.....standing ovation!","08 31, 2012",AG3IRZ6I65KST,Felisha Bradshaw We Are The Urban Community...,AN ANALYTICAL VIEWPOINT OF S.

573292,B00DQSVG9W,"[0, 0]",2,"2 Hearts from MM Good Book Reviews Reviewed by ThommieThe blurb said it clearly, yet I somehow failed to see exactly what it meant this is the first instalment in a serialized novel. What I found out after I read this was the fact that this entire series reminded me so much of free reads on blogs. You know the idea. An author writes a chapter every now and then and you have to sit and wait for the next, and the next. The big difference here is that you get to download this one, and it8217s not nearly as enticing as some free reads out there that literally blow your mind.The blurb also seems a bit leading in my opinion, especially that last line Can a dragon and a wolf beat the odds in a dark fantasy world? I8217d like to know the answer to that question myself seeing, as I didn8217t get it from this first title. I find it really annoying when you get mislead like this.Now plot-wise, there wasn8217t much of a plot. What I read was simply bland sex and damn me if I got why. Selem belongs to a Dragon Clan that has some really weird ways. They count the number of a youngling8217s scales and if the number is high enough, they deem that young8217un weak and cut off his tail. Effectively cutting off his ability to shift into a full dragon when he8217s to come of age. Not only that, but to appease the infuriated dragon, which can8217t shift, the weak (servant) shifter must be claimed and tamed. So this is Selem8217s fate, his duty, but that doesn8217t mean that he likes his chosen mate, no. I loathed him deeply. And after his mate-to-be nearly rapes him, Selem runs of for the rest of the week, he has his freedom.And that how the story begins. His mate to be gets angered and chases him, attacking him as well and managing to bring him down. Wounded Selem accepts Jace8217s help and that leads to the interesting (interesting in the same manner as observing a bug while pinning its head) part of mating with the wolf8230And that was it! Huge spoilers here I know, I have no excuse beside the fact that I don8217t know how to express the disappointment in this title. Plotless sex was what it was. I don8217t know if it would have been different if all the titles were bound together into one piece, but as they are, I find it really hard to recommend this to someone. Had it been more enticing perhaps, had a bit of a plot, made a bit more sense, but as it is it8217s just not worth it in my eyes.","07 16, 2014",AM5PM9T8COWAJ,Pixie Mmgoodbookreviews,2 Hearts from MM Good Book Reviews,1405468800,0.0,False,2.0

Today, I concentrated on 'Tigers', also known as the Big Cat.Tigers are amazing creatures, indeed. I have only seen them in person in the zoo. Of course, I have seen them in film and on television. I learned a great deal about tigers from this book, and my granddaughter was fascinated with them. Here are a few facts I learned, I will leave most of them for you to read about.Tigers are the largest of cats. They have been known to roam this world for 2 millin years. The average tiger is 11 feet long and weighs 670 pounds. Can you even imagine? They live in Asia and Far East Russia. Tigers have the brightest of eyes, and hunt at night when their eyes are 6 times that of humans. They have the greatest of roars, and they also have what is called an 'infrasound' which is below the human hearing range. You may not be able to hear the tiger, but you can feel it in your bones. They love to swim, and they can swim up to 18 miles per day. One of the saddest facts is that the tiger is an endangered species, there are only 400 in the world.The pictures in this ebook are brilliant. Each type of tiger is described, and you can see the picture of that tiger. The picture of their eyes is breathtaking, yellow/green eyes that seem to see into your soul. All aspects of a tiger are discussed. Almost any question you might have about them are described.

587003,B00DY8HARG,"[0, 0]",5,"This book had me so enraptured that I could not put it down! No matter how hard I tried. Really - I tried. I knew I was staying up WAY too late and I needed to get some sleep, so I would put the book down and lay there thinking about it until I couldn't stand it anymore and picked it back up again. I did this twice. Finally, I gave up and read until 4:00 AM, when I finally finished the book. So, do NOT do what I did and start reading this book at 10:30 at night - it will not go well for you. You have been warned.I don't want to rehash the plot much because I don't want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that both main characters, Nova and Quinton, are broken, chased by death and beaten into submission. They're both coping with their brokenness in the only way they know how, but they're really just causing themselves more pain. When Nova and Quinton meet, they are drawn to each other, despite their best efforts to stay numb. The question is, will they be able to fight against the pain of their pasts and help each other to heal or will they simply spiral down into darkness together?The negatives:The Ending.No, no, no, no, no, no, NO! How did I not realize that this was the first book in a series?! Honestly, there was nothing wrong with the ending to this book, if you are aware going in that this is book 1 in a series (which now you are!). But, I was all ready for a nice little wrap-up, maybe an epilogue that brought the whole story to a close - and I was crushed when I realized the state that the characters were being left in at the end of this book! (It didn't help that my sneaky Kindle told me I still had 5% left of the book, when it was really just counting previews of other books). I was shocked! And appalled! And I need the next book NOW!!! (So, now that you're forewarned, this isn't really a negative - at least it won't be for you).Similarities between Quinton and Landon.I wish that there hadn't been quite so many similarities between Quinton and Nova's ex-boyfriend Landon. The fact that they were both artists and loved to sketch seemed just a little too conveniently coincidental and I think that Sorenson could have drawn parallels between the two characters without them being so alike in this way. But, this was really just a personal preference and I was able to move past this issue pretty easily and just enjoy the book.What I LOVED:The emotional resonance.Get ready to have your heart ripped out and stomped on. Repeatedly. As I said before, both Nova and Quinton are incredibly broken. Throughout the book, you get more and more details about how they got that way. It isn't pretty. In fact, nothing about this book is pretty - even the beautiful parts. I had a hollow ache in my chest for most of the time that I was reading this book because I just couldn't stand what was happening to both Nova and Quinton. This is just the emotional response that you want from a book like this!Nova and Quinton.I absolutely adored both Nova and Quinton. Despite Nova's propensity for OCD behaviors and panic attacks, she somehow remains likable (no easy feat). Even though she is flawed in many ways and I sometimes hated her choices, everything that she did was realistic and understandable considering her tragic circumstances. And, most of all, I was always emotionally connected to her, so I was completely invested in her story. Likewise, I was in LOVE with Quinton. I am a complete sucker for the broken but beautiful guy (at least fictional ones!) and Quinton fit this bill perfectly. His story was almost more tragic than Nova's and the guilt and horror that ripped him apart was palpable. I wanted nothing more than for both him and Nova to somehow find redemption and healing in each other.The Writing.I loved Sorenson's beautiful, almost poetic writing (even when she is writing about pain and death). There were so many moments in this book that were just amazing - and I didn't want them to end. I will definitely be reading more Jessica Sorenson in the future!Breaking Nova is a spectacularly heartbreaking book that will keep you reading until the wee hours of the night! You have to go get this book. Now.***Disclosure: This book was provided to me by the NetGalley and Forever in exchange for an honest review. No other compensation was given.

But what if the wounds don't heal correctly, like when cuts leave behind nasty scars, or when broken bones mend together, but aren't as smooth anymore?In the rarest of moments, I manage to get it right: to smile without feeling guilty about it.Quinton Carter:I get high, I dry meaningless shit, and I f***. That's it. Because if I do anything else, my life will have purpose and I deserve to be miserable until my life comes to an end, which is hopefully soon.Nova Reed and Quinton Carter are two messed-up souls living a life of regrets. Nova found her boyfriend after he committed suicide and carries the weight of his guilt on her shoulders, convinced she could have avoided it. Now she barely manages to get ahead in life, afraid of the unknown, and trying to deal with it by obsessive-compulsive counting, the only things helping her to have a little control. Quinton carries the weight of death on his shoulder, as he's the only survivor of a car crash in which he was the driver, and which killed both his girlfriend Lexi and her friend Ryder. His only way to cope is to get high on weed, and wait for death because he feels like he doesn't deserve to live.When their worlds collide, they discover a mutual attraction for each other, but whereas Nova feels like she needs to help Quinton as a way of making amends for not having avoided her boyfriend's suicide, Quinton is afraid of commitment due to a promise he made to Lexi and especially because he doesn't want to drag her into his self-induced downwards spiral.But it's already too late as Nova is dragged into Quinton's circle and has her first taste of weed, helping her to numb her guilt...This was a very dark read and very interesting. I read many dealing with grief stories but never once have I read one that so deeply dives into drug-abuse as a way of coping. It was a new approach to dealing with regrets and grief, and I was fascinated by how Jessica Sorensen depicts Nova and Quinton's thinking through alternating points of view.The only thing I'd like to criticise would be the pace, as the book has a weird one, where some events move really slowly and then suddenly you find yourself propelled to much later in time... And in the end, looking at the big picture ie. the entire book, not too much has happened.That's because Breaking Nova is just the beginning of Nova and Quinton's story and this first part's morally is that you have to help yourself first before you are able to help someone else. There's not really a cliffhanger, but it entices you to read the next book in the series.

He's her ex-boyfriend who viciously ripped her heart out and slapped it back in with holes a plenty. Well it's been six years, people do get over things like that right? He's not there for love though (or is he?), and Ellie is horrified when she realizes what he needs her for just might be the answer to what has her all messed up. But what's the price on shattered hearts these days? And, in leaving with Javier, she's also left behind her new love, Camden McQueen. He's got his child and ex-wife to take care of, but things are never what they appear to be when Ellie Watt is involved. `Tis the life of a Con Artist right?A tumultuous ride through the lives of three epically messed up souls who bring to each other more than any of them can imagine.

It might not make sense in parts, but it will not tell you anything important about the story. For details you will have to read it yourself. I guarantee you will want to read it. If you haven't already bought it, for cripes sake go buy it. NOW! Too many times I have read a book that blew my mind, then, when the long awaited sequel comes out, it just isn't as good. I was worried. I mean, if you read my review for Sins and Needles HERE you know that book kicked my ass. So I went into this book cautiously optimistic.Let me lay your fears to rest: Shooting Scars is just as mind blowing, gut wrenching and full of, Oh *BLEEP*, NO! moments as Sins and Needles was.Shooting Scars picks right up where Sins and Needles (SN from here out) left off. Javier is taking Ellie away and Camden is left with Sophia.  I just knew something was up and I was proven right! Obviously psycho Javier is up to no good. That is a given. What happens on the Camden end...you'll never *Bleep* believe it. Or maybe you will, if like me, you had an immediate distrust of that crazy wench he was married to. Then, holy crap, the *bleep* hits the fan. People, I got this book and I never stopped reading until it was over. Mr. Love Books had to bring me dinner in the bedroom where I was holed up. In between me shooting texts to Amy:~ ME: 86% Hope you pre-ordered this. HOLY *bleep*!Amy: I didn't but now I want to know what's happening!!!!!! LolAmy: Don't tell me!!!Me: Not going to but this is gonna get the elusive *bleep* label on the  reviewMe: oh holy *bleep* god. NOOOOOO!Amy: aggggggggggh!!!! You're going to kill me! I will die of suspense!Me: Um, just one thing...pre-order it. Like NOW! ~I spent the entire book in a state of what the *bleep*! That did NOT just happen I am torn. I know, deep down I know that Javier is a psycho. After SN I would have said no way in *bleep* could this ever happen...but Ms. Halle did the impossible. I am torn. I want to be team Camden, but in this book we saw a side of him that just magnifies what we saw in SN. That scene, where he does that thing with the *shudders* thing to get the information...I was totally squicked. I think he just went to a whole new level of the badness we saw before. I am kind of on Team Javier now. But not totally. I mean, how can I be? With all the crap he pulls? And what he does to Ellie and the lies he tells her? I know it's so wrong, but I am just going to say it. Javier is so bad boy, and I mean not in a good way, but still hot. Oh crap. I went there. Now y'all are thinking I'm crazy. You'll have to read it to see what I mean.OK, I know this review is going crazy long, but not done yet.  Throughout, the book once again took me, turned me upside down, shook me, flipped me in a few circles, just when I thought I would puke, put me right side up again, then kicked me in the gut for good measure. Yeah, it's the same words from a portion of the SN review, but oh so accurate. This time we got chapters alternating in Cam and Ellie's POV. Each time I wasn't ready for the switch. Didn't want to leave Ellie then I started reading Camden and was engrossed. Then, vice versa. Head Spinning.OK let's wrap this up. I got some of the answers I wanted, but in the end, am left with more questions! Yeah, you guessed it! Cliffhanger city. *sobs* There is so much I am in the dark about. Does blank make it? What about when you know who found out she was you know who and then she left you know who behind? You are not gonna believe how this ends, and what's gonna happen in the next book, Bold Tricks! (I only know what I read in the teaser chapter at the end, so put down your lynch mob torches.)~ Ms. Halle, why do you have to be so good at ripping our guts out, making us think there is a happy ending, then leaving us hanging upside down on the roller coaster like it suddenly broke down and the maintenance men are on break?

Except perhaps that this is the first one I've read where the hero is Greek. So what makes this different? I've said it in my former reviews, a lot of author can make good stories but only few can put emotion in them. Despite the story being common, I liked how Marian put emotion in all the right places. It's one thing to make your characters feel but it's another thing to make your readers feel with them. Heart racer is all about that, making you feel anxious, happy, sad and broke your heart right when the characters dive into those emotions.  Bobby and Leandro pulled me in as if I was actually there experiencing their journey and seeing everything with my own eyes.Another thing about this is that, even though it's a college romance, I like how Marian Tee made her characters matured enough that it is okay to believe that they are in love despite their age. I've been reading a lot of NA lately and I figured that it's the characters maturity and not really the age that makes it hard for me to believe in them and that's where Marian have delivered the story well.","06 23, 2014",A26CYJO0GEN5FI,valerie shyne,Another emotional read from Marian Tee!,1403481600,0.0,False,4.0

If I had to read one more time that Dominic was God-Like, I thought I was going to scream.  Or throw my kindle across the room.  I'd much rather read a description on WHY he was God-Like.  Don't just say it.  Same with Gen.  She was all that, yet why??  No clue.  Never saw it.  And the Hot Rush Bunch?  Or whatever they were called?  I was told they were all HOT.  Never saw it for myself.  At least with KA, when Luke or Vance or Lee walked into a room, I could SEE it in my mind.  She never had to say they were hot.  I could FEEL it.  Not so much with this bunch.  I admit, I am curious about Nick, Jase, Ben and the group, but am I curious enough to read another in the series?  No.  Not really.  If the second book ever comes up free, maybe.So this wasn't a bad book, I've read much worse.  I guess I had really high expectations, reading about all the Rock Chick references, and because of that, this was a total let down.

203039,B007QOZ1S4,"[1, 2]",2,"The author starts strong with builder, the first book in the series, but by the third book, is extremely lazy and repetitive in character development and story line.  The author creates a very interesting world and an extremely interesting premise in which the world is geographically and culturally divided between 6 or 7 belief systems of which pure science and pure magic are two.  But the reader gets virtually nothing but minor sentences here and there about the other 4 or 5 other belief systems.  The author starts off strong with interesting characters.  But the author fails, and in a substantial way, because his main character Tor advances too quickly in developing essentially god like powers to solve every day problems with magical builds but has no ego or sense of self worth (because of his DNA).  The failure is that the author repeats this theme over and over and over in every book with only minor advancement of the character.  The fact the author takes 5 books to develop only 2 of the 7 or more belief systems that exist in his world is lazy, in my opinion.  The repetition of the  main character apologizing for actions that dramatically change the lives in his kingdom in all the books is lazy.  The author also dwells extensively on sexual morays too repetitively.  Over and over and over and over in all the books and it is really boring.  In fact as the number of books progress, the initial hurdles, the rule systems, interactions, morays and explanations and problem solving are repeated time and again without any major development or advancement.  The main character solves virtually every problem by building a new magical construct, and then has the ability to reproduce it by the thousands, which makes him, essentially, a walking, but ego free, god.  This is ok for a novel or two, but not for 5 books.  Over this many books, it is lazy and repetitive.  The author starts with a potentially interesting cast of characters, such as Kolb, Richard the King, a royal guard woman , and his best friend, but all of these characters fail to develop and end up as 2 dimensional.  Really one dimensional.  The author could have been much stronger had he written chapters from perspective of the other characters.  The author, by book 3 or 4, could and should have developed more than 2 of the 6 or 7 world views (he only delves into pure science and pure magic).  The author could and should have taken magic versus each different belief system in each book/installment.  That would have been real work for him.  Instead, readers get shortchanged.  Supposedly, for two or three books, there is a war declared and going on, but no actual battles.  The author spends extensive time for preparation of war, but gives no explanation why there are no major incursions, and nothing characteristic of an actual war.  Only spies trying to kill people.  He prepares all these shields and weapons, but they never actually get used in any battles where the reader might see science and magic in direct opposition on a major scale.  I would recommend the first two books, but I would not recommend anything thereafter.  The author needs more action, better development of the various belief systems, more backstory of the ancients, and less repetition of arranged marriages, stupid feudal customs, loving everyone, sexual morays.  I feel like the money was well spent on the first two novels, but then I would want a refund on each of the books thereafter.","08 3, 2012",A32KH5UE00PHLV,Expert Reader 1 Spot On Review,The series starts strong is too repetitive,1343952000,0.5,True,2.0

Her sister, Heather, is worried Cam's reveal will ruin her wedding and hatches a plan to save her day and Cam any further embarrassment by suggesting Cam pretend someone else is her boyfriend. Not knowing who to choose, Heather suggests none other than Troy Lanske, a long-time, close friend of the family and their brother, Fisher's best friend.Cam is hesitant at first, thinking the family will never believe that a guy like Troy would ever consider dating a girl like her, but not knowing what else to do, decides to try it, telling Troy they can break up after the wedding.From the very first chapter, I knew I would love this book.

The three short stories are not specifically related in any way, yet the way Mr. Cognard has woven them into a single, longer story works very well.The entire presentation is fun to read, and is completely appropriate for adults as well as children. This book is written in a style and manner that a young reader could handle, yet it would be equally entertaining for even younger children to have read to them. In the case of the younger children, it would be reasonable to read each of the three short stories on separate nights, thus stretching the book out over three nights of bedtime stories.It's been half a century since I could be considered a young reader, or an even younger child but I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Not only did I enjoy the overall story, but I enjoyed each of the three campfire tales as told by the siblings. There is nothing in this book that could even remotely scare a child, or cause one to have nightmares. Quite the contrary, I believe both boys and girls will find this book to be delightful.

At one point, the heroine spent two days alone, yet started thinking about what happened with her two friends the night before. She also resumed painting, something she had put aside for a long period of time, and created (in her sleep) a portrait of one of the ghosts haunting the area. However, when the malevolent spirit came and caused major destruction in the cabin she was renting, not once did she mention what became of the painting...nor did she ever mention it again, or any of the other paintings she created while there.

Especially after an encounter with a hot and dangerous biker got her fired from one place. The straight-laced country girl was equal parts intrigued and pissed off with the crass and apparent callous MC vice president and had no qualms at all about getting in his face to let him know exactly how she felt. Men had walked over her long enough and she was done with that!Never had Scott Cole encountered a female so aggrevating and seductive at the same time. Growing up in an MC, he had never known innocence, only loyalty and duty - and lots of willing, eager females throwing themselves at him. Harlow was nothing like that. Not willing, not eager and seemed to be as innocent as the day she was born. And as she drove him crazier with every encounter, she also dug herself deeper under his skin.Involved in potentially explosive negotiations between rivaling MC's, Scott can't afford to have his attention diverted. But Harlow turns out to be more than just a diversion, and unfortunately his enemies have picked up on that fact. When it is obvious they have found Scott's potential weak spot in Harlow, he has no choice but to make his claim clear. Not that he is really complaining........******Friggin' AWESOME!!Love Nina Levine's story-telling!! Her men are finger-lickin' yummy Alphas and her women are kick-ass, smart-mouthed beauts!!The backstory for Storm MC is an ongoing one, where Madison from book 1 STORM and her brother, Scott, from book 2 FIERCE, both children of the President have recently discovered they have a half-brother, Blade, by merit of a philandering father, who maintained a separate family for years. The family in disarray, the MC is struggling to maintain integrity despite the family dischord. Not an easy task when family and MC are almost synonimous.Scott carries a tremendous amount of anger, mostly directed at his father, but it filters out in everything he does. Disappointment and desillusionment are at the source of his ire and it only feeds his conviction that unencumbered and free are the way to go, and commitment and love don't exist. Enter Harlow to knock him right on his arse........Perhaps uninitiated, but by no means innocent, Harlow may not be wise to the ways of the life of a biker, but that doesn't mean she is intimidated by it. Knocked about emotionally once too many times before, she doesn't cower, instead stands her ground and holds her own. She is also refreshingly forward with her needs and desires and completely without guile.The contrast in background is no match for the chemistry that burns between them and Ms. Levine has the ability to paint us a very vivid picture of the spontaneous combustion when the two meet in the middle!!10024A deliciously deviant dichotomy of opposites attracting.10024**Copy provided in return for an honest review.**","03 1, 2014",A1O5BMIWBH4OG2,Ripe for Reader Margreet,10024A deliciously deviant dichotomy of opposites attracting.10024,1393632000,0.9166666666666666,True,4.74468085106383

Arthur is dying of brain cancer and by coincidence his patient, Richard needs a place to live after losing his position as a surgeon at the same hospital where Arthur's wife was also employed as a physician.Arthur is declining rapidly but he still has enough mental audacity to plan Richard's demise. But the race is on and the Grim Reaper is gaining ground every hour.Every character in this book has a grief stricken back story. The only happy story might be rose who keeps a rare tropical plant that takes up one whole bedroom. If it is not carefully attended..it too will die a miserable death.Author Khan loves details. He will give you more than you really need to know about every thing including in bold type, TEN LIFE LESSONS  learned from his father.There is tension and plenty of things going wrong in this 100 year old Condo but there is too much repetition of the floodingScene, the headaches, and the flashbacks. Way too much .description.The author needs brevity. Find a way to say more by saying less.The author depends on coincidence too often. Example: He hires a  Private Investigator to find His wife's parents. It takes five years but they are found in the Ukraine and flown to the US so that they may attend Martha's 40th Birthday. Theirtaxi is broadsided and they are killed just blocks away from the party.Just one of the unnecessary scenes adding more depression to the story.The chapters don't flow well. Not all the scenes are causally and believabley  tied to the ones that precede and follow them.Transitions are not smooth. The story is choppy.The ending is too predictable and contrived. The story was moved forward by relentless action rather than being tension driven. The ending was inevitable.In my opinion the book appears to be a first draft . It would have benefited by submission to an editor .The author gifted the book to me with his request for my reviewand I appreciate his confidence.

This is just makes the list longer. This was truly an instant true love book.  I so so so love nerdy men and Mason was a a well built nerd at that!  Then there was Adrianne.  She was such a neat change from other female characters. I loved her dirty talk.  You do not always see that in female characters as the instigator of such talk.  But she was so fun to read.  The way she went for it with Mason each time they were together, even after just meeting.  Loved their instantaneous chemistry! The story line was great.  Flowed quickly and had funny parts as well as sad and endearing moments.  Now I will have to impatiently wait for the next book in the series.  Cannot wait!Finding the Right GirlOh my freaking goodness!  I didn't think I could love Brian more after reading him in the Nice Girl to Love series, but man do I ever.  He is perfect, everything you could want in a hero.  He is sexy, sweet, sincere, loving, take charge, fierce, protective...everything!  Then there is Tessa!  What a beautiful soul.  Always wanting to help others and put them before herself.  And their chemistry together was heartwarming, fire at times and sweet at others.  I loved this story so much.  The way the first series ended with the two of them meeting, you could tell their story would be special.  It just totally touched my heart.  Tears of joy, sadness, and fear all in one story.  What an amazing story of never giving up!  Wow!On Any Given SundaeA book about desserts is right up my alley.  First I have to say I adored Elizabeth.  Maybe because I could relate to her feelings of inadequacy.  And Rob was a gem.  a truly noble male character, flaws and all.  This is a book where I think maybe for the first time I did not get angry with a lead character for when the relationship kinda went off course.  It was a little heartbreaking at that point and made me feel so sad.  But I loved the way the characters came together at first and again towards the end.  It was a very cute sweet story, endearing.  And it was a first of Marilyn Brant's for me too.Sweet To YouI loved this book.  I loved that Maddie and Jamison were friends most of their lives before they clicked.  Their story was a fun read that also included hotness, insane chemistry, true friendship and honest discussions.  Even in the angsty part, I liked the way it was handled.  Apparently this is the third book in the series, so I am excited I get to go back and read the others to get more of these characters.","06 24, 2014",A3G1XMJZC77GDB,Lorigonzo,Loved this collection!

Lawyer Andrew Thoreau Hamilton is the epitome of that smug, oh-so-beautiful, arrogant jerk-off.  I mean the first line in the synopsis tells you exactly the kind of man he is, My cock has an appetite.  And because I'm a shameless floozy, this one sentence instantly had me wanting to read this story.Andrew is a love them and leave them' kind of guy.  Battling demons from his past (aren't they always?), he is a serial one night stand type of dater.  He has yet to meet a woman who will change his ways.  After hitting a dry spell in his man-whoring activities, Andrew meets newbie lawyer Alyssa/Aubrey on a lawyer networking site.  Aubrey is seemingly immune to Andrew's charms and they form an anonymous friendship in the process.  Unfortunately, Andrew has a huge problem with liars and Alyssa/Aubrey has committed this sin against him.  The ensuing angst that unfolds between them is why I love romance reads!I was surprised how well the author was able to give depth to the characters in such a short story.  I really connected with Andrew and Aubrey.  Their chemistry together is off the charts HOT!  And the sex scenes are a freaking inferno.  I chuckled to myself when I read her acknowledgement and she said she wanted to write fade to black for the sex scenes.  She did a fantastic job of writing them.  She should not be embarrassed by it at all!Do yourself a favor and buy Reasonable Doubt.  It's a so well-written and sexy as hell.  It's a short read so you can get yourself all worked up during your lunch hour.  This is a serial series, so you are left with a bit of a cliffhanger.  But it didn't upset me in the least.

I am so happy it was dual POV , I am a lover of the male POV and after reading Fury I needed to know my Hunter's thoughts and feelings !! I admit I assumed Hunter was going to be an arrogant , cocky , a$$ and OK so he may be those things but when he loves he loves completely and never once did I worry about their faithfulness to one another and that was a plus. There is enough drama in their story , no need for cheating and crazy ex's !! The sex in this book is off the charts HOT !! Love that raw gritty need you now sex !!We start off with Hunter and Autumn picking up Jessie from jail. Hunter was having a hard time letting Autumn into this part of his life but it was good to see him open up and let her in. It never mattered to her what his childhood was like or what type of home he was raised in , all she wanted was to know him better. When he finally realized that and let her in it actually helped her realize a few things about him that she misunderstood. We also get a glimpse into Jessie's life while Hunter is reliving the horror of their mom. The brothers are struggling between jobs , money and Hunter's education , and it is really tense for awhile. But once Hunter makes his mind up there is no turning back and his fighting actually saves the whole story. He is finally happy doing something he loves and making a difference doing it. Once everyone is content with his choices we get more HOT SEX and lots of love.Autumn father is not happy with her choices but her mom is thrilled for her. Hunter is determined to help Autumn's mom get better and it is very touching to see this side of Hunter. Throughout the whole book I just love him to pieces , he is so freakin HOT , but he loves his Leafy so much it is refreshing to read a book with this much love. They have to deal with their past demons , Autumn's dad, her moms sickness and the distance between them when Hunter drops out of school. This book is about overcoming all of these struggles and knowing that love can be enough to change your life.I am so thrilled with their HEA , it is perfect and I am so satisfied with the ending to their story !!","05 13, 2014",A1X5V3LU8TC8QU,amie,love me some HUnter,1399939200,1.0,True,5.0

This time they are in Egypt to complete a dig that Nick first started with his best friend Mario before Maries Uncle had murdered him. Nick hopes that not only will he find the gold that is supposed to surpass anything they have found so far but that he will also be able to put his demons to rest concerning Mario and move on with his life without nightmares. This time they are joined by someone Marie knows through her father. Akiiki.Not long after they get there Nick feels that the spot they originally tried to dig at was not the right spot so he wanted to look elsewhere. When they finally camp out at the spot that Nick feels is right Akiiki gives them the warning that the pyramid they are looking for may belong to Sekmet and that if it is then what they had went through before was nothing. That night after Nick goes to sleep he has a very realistic dream about his father. More of a premonition of things to come.Right after they find a door and gold they are attacked and taken prisoner by bandits once again. This ones leaders name is Motumbo. He is probably the most ruthless out of all the ones they have dealt with so far. He is very angry because all the gold Nick says they found is all of a sudden gone. There is an assumed casualty on Nicks end but all is not as it seems... Nick of course is his attitude laden self. Once again it will take some quick thinking on Nicks part along with some unexpected help to get them out of the dire situation that they find themselves in.This really was the best one yet. There was more of danger aspect to it. More ruthless villains. The first two books had more realistic situations in it. This one had a bit more of a supernatural aspect something you would have to have an open mind for if you are not into the supernatural.

(a person can dream, can't they?)I was especially pleased when an early scenario came to a satisfying, timely resolution.  I looked forward to enjoying the rest of a fast paced read.Sadly, this wasn't meant to be.  The last 2/3 of the book could have been told in half the time.  The story started to drag and meander.  The reader can see where the book is going, but it takes such a long, round-about way to get there that I found myself skimming trying to get to the inevitable conclusion.Two other negative points were: 1) It was difficult to get in the government's corner over the root issue.  Without giving anything away, I could definitely see the terrorist's point when it came to their outrage against the U.S.2) The suspense of this book took a hit when it became apparent that the only truly 'together' group in this tale was the mafia portion.  Neither the government agencies nor the terrorist group were very bright or formidable.  Some of the passages were truly cringe worthy.A HUGE turn off for me was the inclusion of a romantic twist.  I absolutely HATE that.  I would love to find a well written mystery/ thriller that does not pander to the unnecessary tendency to include a love story.To me, nothing weakens a thriller like having some soppy mess thrown in just to satisfy...what?  I don't even know.  It's completely ridiculous.  In this tale you have agents navigating the woods in search of a terrorist stronghold.  These are supposedly the 'best of the best' and the situation is of dire national importance.  So what does the author do?  He throws in romantic schlock so that two of the agents can become distracted and waste the reader's time with idiotic inner musings.  The middle of a life and death situation is not the time for that crap.  It's a cheap device and I abhor authors who employ it.Along that same vein, I quickly became tired of the protagonist's wife whining about his job and its effect on their marriage.  She knew it going in, but takes every opportunity to make him feel guilty...even in the midst of a terrible national crisis.Perhaps the subsequent books in this series are better.  This one, however, seems disjointed and covers too much ground to be plausible or enjoyable.I would hesitate to read another book in this series because this one was so difficult to slog through until the end.","06 3, 2014",AFAIEJL65GKRK,DeeDee Brown,Didn't Live Up To Potential,1401753600,0.5,True,3.7142857142857144

Half-Sidhe and half-shifter, she has the best of both worlds, but only one of them will define her in more ways than one. She's lived her life her way for as long as she can remember and wouldn't have things any other way. She has anything and everything she could ever want, when she wants it. A certainty that suits her lifestyle very well.Unfortunately, not every aspect of her life is as rosy as it seems. She's picked up after her older sister, Lena, every time she gets herself into trouble. Lena is a V Neg addict and will do anything to experience the thrill of a high whenever possible. She's used to living the high life and isn't afraid to show it. Angelika knows she'll gladly help her sister out whenever possible, after all, she's family. Yet the fact that she's had to do so repeatedly has started to take its toll.Summoned to New Orleans on her sister's behalf, Angelika isn't sure as to what she'll encounter there. She's been told that her sister's boyfriend has a proposition for her, but the prospect doesn't really seem that enticing to her. Deep inside, she knows that whatever her sister has up her sleep, it won't be pretty. Yet her curiosity has gotten the best of her. She needs to know what it is that Lena wants, if only to ease her own piece of mind.When Lena unexpectedly goes missing, she soon realizes that there's more afoot than she'd imagined. Someone's out to teach her sister a lesson and she's not sure as to who that could be. Surrounded by her sister's current boyfriend and her ex, she can't deny that both men stir her desires. Part of her wants to indulge in sampling what they're able to give her, but she knows that's not likely since Lena's nowhere to be found.Her utmost goal is to find her sister and make sure that she's brought back in one piece. The possibility of that very fact isn't likely, but for her sake, she'll do anything to make sure she's found intact. As tensions between every Supernatural faction mount, Angelika soon realizes that she'll need to act as some sort of mediator if she's to bring her sister home, once and for all. To do that, she'll need to come to terms with the secrets of her past and that of her own family. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done.This was quite a riveting story. Full of vampires, werewolves, faeries, and every other Supernatural imaginable, the story is sure to capture the reader's attention from the get-go. It's pages are chock-full of intrigue, romance, and graphic violence. Granted, this sort of thing isn't for everyone.This series ties in with Danielle's Vamp Saga. If you haven't read any of those books yet, you might want to, since it'll give the reader a better idea of the world she's created for both of her series. I did note, here and there, that there was a little too much information provided in order to tie-in the bloodlines and their respective lineages. I get that some of it was necessary, but at times it felt as if too much precedence was taken in regards to it.

First, the story was just too far fetched and ridiculous - a meddling father, who is also a successful business man, who sends his secretary to his son's house in a snow storm with a completely trumped up story of needing papers that were delivered to the office after he left? Which he told her about as he was leaving the office? Come on.But what really got to me was the lack of editing - incorrect words used, either incorrect grammar, extra words or just the wrong word, as well as the general writing. For example: Beside the fact that Lucas had pretty much removed himself from the normal life as much as possible, William Montgomery did not get to be a financial success that he was, Tell her to let me know when she wants them for and I'll be sure to get them to her, It would be wonderful if the courier arrived within the next couple of hours so that she could be leave the office by two, No words could have taken the wind out of his sales, he would be in treatment longer that anticipated, went off the narrow path of his driveway and into the to ravine below, etc. etc.Then there are the descriptions of Lucas' feelings. Emma, who he has barely spoken to for the two years she's been in his father's employ, bumps her head when her car goes off the road and passes out, and  She wasn't moving and that was killing him. Killing him??? Then when she wakes up and says she hurts all over, his response is That's my girl. What? At this point in the book, there has simply not been enough character development to know how Lucas feels that this comment sounds anywhere close to plausible. Then Emma whined. And then, when Emma said she'd be fine and didn't need Lucas waiting on her, Lucas' face was a portrait of barely concealed rage. Really??? Barely concealed rage because she won't play the damsel in distress and let him wait on her??Ridiculous, juvenile, poorly written and even more poorly edited.

It was equal parts sexy and enticing, but at the same time, where most stories would feel clicheacute, this story has that something special. The natural spark of red hot smokin' chemistry between Adam and Taylor was obvious from the start. I found this was one of those books I couldn't put down. I was even anti-social to the point of ignoring my family during dinner to finish reading it! What I liked about Adam was his natural charm and raw animal appeal while also having that whole sexy dominant control thing going on. A lot of writers try to achieve a dominating hero and fail, but Kennedy is one of the few who has succeeded and done a fantastic job. I got hot just reading the initial scene where he's daring her to call for help when he handcuffs her to his yacht's rail. Totally HOT!But the most amazing part of the book is when Adam convinces Taylor to surrender to him more than just her body. He uses the dominant/submissive style interaction to break through her barriers and get her to relinquish her ice queen persona. She finally gives in and opens herself completely, even going so far as to finally tell him what her real first name is since she only goes by Taylor which is her middle name. The emotion behind this particular interaction between Adam and Taylor is entirely believable and incredibly moving.

Every once in a while, she puts out one that just seems to have an unexpected charm to it that makes it especially delightful. Forever Yours is one of them.When the young wolf shifter Kory was out one night, he was seriously grossed out to find a badly burned corpse in the woods. He was even more stunned when it opened its eyes, grabbed him, and then bit into his neck with fangs. At this point we find out that the vampire prince Dante wasn't killed when his coven was decimated. Not only is he alive, but Kory is his mate. Kory takes him home and helps nurse him back to health, and the fun just begins.Dante is very old and very serious and is totally unused to living in a very modest home with a human family. True, Kory is a shifter, but his young brothers and mothers are human, and Dante has not too thrilled with having to deal with humans, especially when Kory's young brother insists that Dante play dolls with him. And then there's a bungling neighborhood watch group that keeps enlisting Dante's help to battle crime in the neighborhood. Much to his chagrin, they keep returning to him no matter how much he tries to scare them away. As much as he tells himself otherwise, he gradually finds himself caring about these people and finding that his modest place amongst them is more rewarding than he could imagine.With absolutely charming and endearing characters, the story flows smoothly and delightfully to a warm and satisfying ending. It was such a fun treat from Lynn, that I can't imagine anyone who likes her works not enjoying it.","03 2, 2014",A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP,"Robert Carnevali Typical, middle-aged guy",One of Lynn Hagen's more charming stories.,1393718400,0.3333333333333333,True,5.0

21344,B003UD88OY,"[0, 0]",4,"I will admit that I was on the fence the first time I read this story.  I had the same concerns with the story (i.e. Jada's speech having gone to Harvard, her job situation and Aaron's reaction to the news), but when I read it again I understood and liked the story much more.  And since I am probably in the minority because I really didn't care for Trolling Nights (I think Bevin was the most immature and annoying heroine in any of the author's stories), but loved Being Plumville and Beauty Within, I feel like I need to defend the story.I have read all of the reviews and on some points I agree, but this is not your typical erotic IR story.  It is not erotic AT ALL!  In actuality none of the author's stories are.  This story is more about the intimacy the hero and heroine shared.For one...The story was well written.  You can really tell this author does her homework as far as research and the timelines.  The relationship between Aaron and Jada was an intimate one...not one filled with passionate sex.  Some people don't know the difference.  It was the little things that they did like the cupping of the face and the kissing on the temple and forehead.  The reverent touches they shared...those are intimate acts that the writer wrote well and they leapt off the page.  Aaron wanted to be intimate with Jada, not just have sex with her.  That was very refreshing.As far as Jada's speech, I think the reader has to remember that we speak differently according to whom we are speaking regardless of where we went to college.  And the writer shows this clearly in her conversations with her family verses the conversations she had with Mrs. McKensie and the Prescott's.****POSSIBLE SPOILER****As far as Aaron's reaction to the news of Joshua, I can understand why he didn't initially go ballistic on Jada.  I believe he was really in shock.  And eventually after talking to her, he understood why she didn't tell him.  She was a financially lower class black woman that got pregnant by a very rich older white man after a one-night stand and losing her virginity.  She knew she was in love with him, but she just assumed this was a one-time thing with him because he never told her how he felt.  And remember...she asked him was he angry and he told her he was more hurt that she felt she couldn't trust him with that information, but the anger would probably come later.  At that moment he just wanted to see his son.Overall, I really liked the story.  I think the story was written well and I loved that she focuses on intimacy rather than sex in these stories.","09 17, 2013",A2H6SOO305GDGU,Kindle Customer,What a refreshingly intimate tale...,1379376000,0.0,False,4.0

Harley is still trying to deal with the tragic loss of her family, especially her three children. Brock is raising his twins alone after the tragic-loss of his wife when they were 6 months old.

Harley takes the temporary job at Copper Mountain Ranch to get away because she doesn't want to do Christmas with her large family, with its many children, with hers gone. It seems like the perfect position, until Brock's twins arrive.The novella felt so much longer, there was so much emotion. The words escape me. I can say that this was an amazing story. My emotions ran the gamut with Harley. She is such a good person she couldn't let her feelings keep her from taking care of the twins and their father.I have said it before, and I will say it again.

With the exception of the sexual attraction, this story came across as unrealistic.Starting with why they were put together - purely based on their monikers of Ice Queen and Rodeo King.  Uh no, can't see a sponsor putting those two fan demographics together at all.2nd:  the heroine feels compelled to do this promotion in order to help her skating?  Huh?  Money apparently isn't a problem for her.  I guess you're to infer that crowd approval is what sways the judging when they award points for a skating performance?  Again, not seeing the rodeo crowd being an influential one on figure skating judges.3rd:  She is an Olympic caliber athlete.  Granted she has to rest her ankle, but I can't believe in a year leading up to the Olympics, she can take that much time off away from skating.  I would think she'd be filling in the time meeting with choreographers, consulting with coaches, costume fittings, taking a mild level of ballet.  Not just sitting around eating junk food, signing autographs, and having an hour's worth of ankle exercise.4th: the heroine is so pathetic - she has no friends other than her manager. She wallows in self-pity to the point where she believes she is unlovable despite being an Olympic champion, beautiful, and financially secure.  WTH?  If she has such low self-esteem, I can't believe the hero would fall in love with her.  Fall in bed with her yes.

I cannot imagine how that must feel not being about to read would devastate me. We have come far in how we deal with dyslexic children. In the past they called them dumb, stupid and lazy to name a few. The truth is just the opposite they are very smart, you would be surprised at the list of famous people who are dyslexic do a search and you will be surprised with the outcome.This book starts out with being in labor giving birth to the so called demon child which in child birth I would think most of us feel this way. The sense of humor in this book is outstanding I laughed the whole way through it. We might not all say what is on our mind when we are in labor but we sure are thinking it. I remember my husband saying honey don8217t look at me like that. My thoughts were BE GLAD I AM LOOKING AND NOT TALKING why I continued giving him that you are an a** hole look.Jules is a sassy outgoing woman who has had to deal with people not understanding her, thinking she dumb, lazy. She is out to show the world how smart she is. In the past she would use sex to cover up her dyslexic so men would not know and be cruel or demean her. In school they laughed at her, her aunt and uncle thought she was lazy they didn8217t try to find out what her issue was. Her brother Jack said when he turned 18 she could come live with him but he moved on and got busy living his life, he had no time to give a child. She had no one to turn to so she became the bad girl. One too many affairs she ends up pregnant with nowhere to turn. She runs to her brother who just doesn8217t understand her she has to fight to get her family back. In doing so she met her best friend Tad.Tad is the playboy with issues of his own, his parents die and he is to blame or so he thinks. He isn8217t good enough for any women and doesn8217t want to get attached to any. He loves and leaves them until one night, one kiss that changes his world. From the first meeting with Jules sparks fly both are attracted to each other but neither want to give up the best friend they ever had. Neither of them knows the other would give anything to just hold and love the other. Tad was there for all the important things in Jules life from giving birth to dealing with Evan (her sons) father issues. Will they ever work out this attraction or will they forever be blinded to the fact that maybe they should be a family.I love a book that deals with serious issues, that teaches us a lesson or reminds us to rethink how we deal with people and their issues. If you add humor then I am hooked. I could not put this book down I loved the sassy, fun loving characters in this book. Their smart ass mouth and ways will keep you laughing at the same time make you sad and want to take them in your arms and give them the support they need. Ms. Meader has a way of writing that makes you feel you are one with each character. She has a way with words that flow easy and never looses you in the type. You feel like you are right there with each laugh, tear, hug and slap. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a learning, laughter, tear jerker, soul searching book.","03 16, 2014",AGBGV16NY06FW,Cyn,A hilarious book with sassy characters that will keep you laughing at the same time dealing with serious issues,1394928000,1.0,True,5.0

When her father takes a risk and decides a remote island is better protection for her condition, her sheltered life is shattered, the truth is revealed, and Iris discovers not only a new world but also herself.I found this story wondrous, poetic, and romantic. I often analyze possible influences when reading fantasy and mythology.I could not pinpoint much because this was highly original. We are just normal people only our souls are a little bit different. (that's eerie and yet fascinating.) I especially loved the symbolism. Such as the apple's introduction was the foreshadowing of Iris' knowledge. I also loved the many fowls referenced. I found myself googling the names to see pictures. It was especially cute when the bird species were used as terms of edurement. I loved it when they talked birdie to me! *LOL*This was written in third person.The pace of the story was abit stop and go. It was a quick read yet it lagged on the conversations, where the author took the liberty of explaining the hidden world of the Society of Feathers. I though the history lesson world building could have been distributed a little more even. There were also poems and songs that I adored. I wish I knew the tunes to them as well.When the romance angle appeared, I found myself groaning, not another psycho heart-throb. Surprisingly, it didn't play out like any other book I've read. Falcon, yep that's his name (cool isn't it), wasn't some bad boy or evil menace. I really liked Iris' character. It's rare that I've read a novel where the heroine wasn't perfect. It was refreshing that Iris had a normal medical condition. Iris' asthma made her appear delicate.One thing I didn't understand was how Iris could be so forgiving when everyone was lying and keeping information from her.I felt bad for her. Everyone has lied to her her whole life and her ailment doesn't make it easy for her to show extreme emotion.I would be interested in continuing this series out of curiosity.

Their estrangement wasn't what she wanted. She thought she could handle it, hoping against hope, that one day they would be able to repair their marriage and go back to the way things were in the beginning. Three long years later and it was beginning to look as though their marriage was over.When Megan Dutton, Elise's lover from twenty years ago suddenly turns up, Elise begins to question whether she should remain in a loveless relationship. Reluctantly, Elise makes the decision to move on. She loves Jill with all her heart, but she needs more, she needs a proper loving relationship.Jill is still madly in love with Elise. She is questioning her own decision of the `in name only' relationship. She can feel herself and Elise drifting further and further apart. Will Jill leave it too late to salvage their marriage?Jill has to swallow her pride and reach out to Elise, she knows this. But doing it is harder than she expected. When Jill finally plucks up the courage to approach Elise, what will Elise's reaction be this late in the game?Two people, soulmates, have allowed outside influences to derail their love for one another. The questions are, will they continue drifting, is their love strong enough to make it a second time round, or will they call it quits?This is the much anticipated, long awaited sequel to The Fix-it Girl. It's here we learn of the outcome of Jill and Elise's, `in name only' pact.As always, with previous JM Dragon books, I was pulled into the story right from the very first page and enthralled with the story right through to the last page. The story flows along at a nice pace. The scenic descriptions allowed me to lose myself in the story with the  characters, to actually be amongst them as the story unfolds. Living the story, rather than reading it.Both Elise and Jill are multidimensional characters, they are as different as night and day, but they are made for one another. Both women are so in love, the heat radiates from the page. Pride got in the way of their love and that pride has to be swallowed. It's here we find out if it is swallowed and the choices that are made.These characters are the same as those from The Fix-it Girl. Each and every one is essential in the progression of the story. There are emotional highs and lows throughout, written so that the reader can feel the angst or happiness. There is also a tender sweet romance, spiced up with some rather hot sex scenes.Although this book concluded, I feel these characters have a lot more to say. It would be absolutely brilliant if JM Dragon wrote another book with Elise and Jill and their family. If any of you have read the Destiny series by JM Dragon, you will know that these characters are very much on a par with Catherine and Jace. Two wonderful characters that have stood the test of time. So, the more books, the merrier for me.I eagerly look forward to another book from JM Dragon soon.","02 22, 2013",A2F4OQ7U55T4Q2,TerryB Lesfic fan,Brilliant sequel,1361491200,1.0,True,5.0

196478,B007MKFM68,"[3, 3]",4,"Big Sound Temple is a very different and rather charming story about a simple man who works as the gardener/janitor at a Japanese Buddhist temple. It's written in Japenglish, something I was initially a little concerned about because I don't usually like reading dialect. Japenglish is English written/spoken as a Japanese person with basic English would speak/write it, so it has all the grammatical faults and lack of punctuation that you'd expect. In this case however, it's perfectly acceptable because it's Hiro's voice.After an initial period of frustration with the rather stilted style, I grew accustomed to it and realised that the very fact that it slowed my reading down added to my experience of the reading as distinctly Japanese. It also expresses Hiro's character perfectly. He is Japanese and he is as simple as his broken English makes him appear. Not simple as in stupid--though his naivety about women and finance does get him into trouble--it's a simplicity of life style and an appreciation for what he has, a very Buddhist kind of simplicity.Hiro is learning English and his tutor suggests that he write a book, so he does--in English. At first I wondered where the story was going, it seemed to be about the details of the life of a gardener, not of terrific interest to me. Where was the antagonist, I wondered? But then she appeared, slowly. She kind of crept up on the story and took it and Hiro's life over. One thing led to another in a wonderful display of the workings of karma. Throughout it, Hiro remained the same simple soul with a fundamentally Japanese Buddhist outlook of kindness, doing the right thing and having an appreciation of the natural world. Hiro is not a religious man. He never mentions actually going to the services in the temple, he just works there, but his respect for the temple and what it represents is clear, and when it comes to the final events, we see exactly how Buddhist he is as heart.I can't say much about the end because I never saw it coming out of such an ordinary life, and I don't want to give out spoilers, but essentially, it shows what turns an ordinary man into a hero--an unwavering goodness and a clear understanding of priorities, at least in this case. It also suggests that the good and the bad do balance out eventually.The story builds to a gripping conclusion that includes Hiro sharing his Buddhist perception of existence, and we are left to contemplate the lessen he learns--that we never know when we are going to die.This book is surprisingly powerful. It had a way of popping back into consciousness long after I'd closed the book. As I reflected on it, I realised how much subtlety was expressed by saying little--a very Buddhist thing to do. Well done, Mr Stevens.I recommend the book, but don't expect anything, or it will not fulfil your expectations. If you expect nothing, you may be delighted. I suggest reading it as you would look at a Japanese garden, the way Hiro looks at his life, with an open mind, ready to accept whatever happens or doesn't happen.Even with its atrocious grammar and appalling lack of punctuation, Big Sound Temple gets a well deserved place on the Awesome Indies.","12 4, 2012",A24RR82KNIG7VZ,Tahlia Newland,A simple charming tale,1354579200,1.0,True,4.0

46785,B004NBZE76,"[5, 5]",4,"Mark Chisnell's THE DEFECTOR is both an adventure story and edge-of-your-seat thriller that's apparently the first in a series - well, at least two books anyway - that, in my reading experience, is from a perspective outside the usual box. More about this later.Here, the protagonist is Martin, a former London currency trader whose love life and professional career hit a major speed bump. Fleeing Old Blighty, he now lives in Thailand attempting to reassemble his life. One night in a Chaweng Beach watering hole, Martin is about to be beaten bloody in a dispute over a bar girl when a stranger intervenes with quick and effective violence on his behalf. The stranger, Janac, is obviously a Hard Guy. Martin is understandably grateful.But Janac, who once may have been a member of an elite American special forces military outfit, has a creepy side. He's obsessed with The Prisoner's Dilemma, a game of hard choices that's too complicated for me to explain here. (Look it up on the Internet or, better still, read this book.) Janac gets his jollies coercing, and then watching, others play the game. And Janac makes sure his version is painful and deadly. Martin soon finds himself enmeshed in a game forced on him by a drug frame-up engineered by his pal Janac, who's also a big time drug dealer. Martin's nightmare has only just begun.Much of THE DEFECTOR takes place on the high seas. Yachting enthusiasts should be particularly engaged. Overall, the novel is punctuated with gritty violence that establishes Janac as a nasty piece of work.I found Martin to be an odd sort of protagonist. He didn't completely earn my sympathy for his plight since he landed between a rock and hard place via a string of bad decisions based on a lack of moral fiber. While saying he got what he deserved would be too strong a position to take, especially since his predicament ultimately results in collateral damage to others, I wasn't rabidly cheering for him either. As a hero, Martin is of the expendable sort.The one thing that prevents me from awarding five stars is an unexplainable contradiction in the evolution of the Janac character when he subjects Martin to the first instance of The Game that involves death to the players as a potential outcome. You should recognize it when you read it, and its puzzling presence is plot-altering.The last pages of this e-book edition of THE DEFECTOR preview the first two chapters of the next in the series,The Wrecking Crew. If you bother to read this sample, you may become intrigued at the direction the author has chosen to take. I've seen it in episodic feature length films but not to date in written fiction. Well, perhaps I need to get out more. In any case, I've already downloaded the second installment.","03 30, 2011",A2DSXA1E02C86D,Joseph Haschka,The first in a series conceived outside the box,1301443200,1.0,True,4.0

Lillian is a strong, positive and open-minded woman, receptive to the huge changes taking place in her own world and the greater world beyond. She's interested in international events as much as in her family and friends, and we learn her attitude to the major happenings of the century - the atomic bomb, the Kennedy assassination, the Iraq war and the political scene in Great Britain. I loved it when Lillian wonders whether at the age of 92 she's too old to learn how to become a computer buff.I found the character of Lillian totally convincing and likeable, and one reason I enjoyed this book is that she reminded me so much of my dear mother-in-law. Both fiercely loyal to family and friends, both born in the early part of the 20th century, and living through many changes and much heartache, they got on with their lives and dealt with their difficulties without complaint, making their way in the world through hard work.As Lillian's family and those of her friends grew exponentially I found it difficult to keep track of all the characters, and although the author includes a dramatis personae at the end, I often struggled to remember who everybody was. Also I felt Lillian's second marriage, and a certain event that I won't mention because it would be a spoiler, were just a little contrived.The ending was completely unexpected.

Her beloved stepfather Pappa Jason has passed away and stipulations in his will dictate that Brenna return to the ranch, with Jase, for a period of three months 8211 and would be unable to sign the entire ranch over to him for at least a year.

Sophie is a girl learning to live again without the love of her life, Jack. She suffers from terrible nightmares and depression. Just getting up and functioning on a daily basis is a hassle. Her and Jack's sister Ana move away to start their life anew. Upon moving to this new town they both meet someone who could not only take their minds off of Jack, but make them happy as well. Drake and Chase are 2 hotties who like to make the ladies happy. They are unhappy with their nightly romps in the sack and are both on the search for something more meaningful when they meet up with Sophie and Ana. Sophie likes Chase...Chase likes Sophie, but Sophie refuses to open up to Chase because of the guilty she feels about being able to move on from Jack. Chase knows nothing of Jack except that Jack broke her heart and he doesn't like him. Not telling Chase the s*** of the situation causes so many problems at one point that Sophie loses her shit and I think possibly her mind for a while. Chase's ex doesn't make it easy for Sophie either. Drake and Ana hit it off so fast that I swear she never gave him back his penis! Seriously though they are perfect together. Drake has probs dealing with Ana's serious commitment issues. But hey, I'd have issues to if I had her past.I loved the characters. Sophie was easy to love, but after a minute I wanted to scream at her your issues are with yourself not with Chase! You know he loves you! Just shut up already and quit feeling guilty! Chase, oh dear lordy sexy hawt Chase. Did I say sey hawt? He's sexy hawt! His personality is to die for, and how any woman can do him the way he was done is beyond me! Drake, just as yummy but waaaaaaay more serious of a guy. Him and Ana perfect for each other. I love the interaction between all the characters. I love all the pov's.What I didn't like is how long the book was. Lordy, lordy! At first I thought my kindle was broken because my percent wasn't increasing. It took me days to read this bad nasty. Because of how long it was and just how much story line and plot it had I felt like it took away from the impact of each separate story line that was there. This could've been 2 separate books that with a touch bit more love could've easily been 5 star books each! Too much going on regardless how good of a story takes away the impact.

It continues on from book 4 in the series.  in this book, Sang and the Academy guys are dealing with loads of things on their hands.  Between Mr.Hendricks questioning Sang, them still trying to complete their Ashley waters assignment, Greg coming back , and secret notes coming from a mysterious person, all while still dealing with their feelings, it makes everything pretty tough.Sang is a shy, pretty, lovable girl with chameleons hair and a big heart she wants to share with everyone. You are going to be surprised at how much drama is going to happen in this book. Let's just say there will be some jealousy.  Sang is beginning to recognise her talents and connection she has with the group.  She is going to learn to stick up for herself, but still show the guys how much she cares for them. You are looking at a new evolved girl.  There hasn't been one time in the book that made me want to stop reading for even a minute. :)Kota is a protective caring guy with a heart full of gold out to give to Sang.  I'm going to tell you right now that there will be a time you look at Kota and shake your head at him.  He starts to get very protective of her and demand more time with her.  Kota will definitely not disappoint.While Kota has a heart of gold, Victor has a heart of gold AND a pocket full of gold. ) In this book, Victor will be one of the main guys in the series.  One reason I like Victor is because he spoils Sang. Lol. he is willing to please her by any means.  Let me just let you know that you will have your draw dropping to the core of the Earth when you read the end of this book.Silas is still the old same Silas.  You won't see too much if him in this book, but I think C.L. Stone said he was going to be one of the main characters in the next book!Nathan is just like Silas.  You don't see much of him till the next book.  There will be a time he sticks up for her but other then that, not much of him.Gabriel is awesome. I love him.  Poor misunderstood Gabriel.  in this book you shall see a more sensitive side towards him towards the end of the book. Let me just say I love the three musketeers! ( Which consists of Luke, Nathan, and Gabriel.)  he has a very key point of the book that makes you really think.Luke is my secret crush. I really want to give you guys a spoiler about him so below I will put spoiler alert in caps.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!: Sang kisses him on the cheek!!!!!!!North is cool as always. DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE OTHER BOOKS....  As you heard from the last book, North was the first to crack and admit his love. There will be someone you can add to that list to later?  Not a whole lot of North if you ask me, but enough to be pleased if I was a huge fan of him....which I am.Mr.Blackbourne and Mr Green (aka Sean)... they will both connect with Sang in this story much to my happiness. Mr.Green will get some nice parts in the story, a little more then Mr.B.Now that I introduced you to the main characters, Ill let you know you will meet MUCH more.  Remember the nerd boy? his name is Will and he will get some parts. We see a little bit of Karen here and there which is nice.  I don't want to spoil this for you so I will say my conclusion. This book is very good and NOT a waste of four dollars.  I swear you will regret it if you don't get it. I beg you!!!!!!!  Since you all keep begging me Ill give you one HINT/SPOILER....

When he enters the tearoom himself he spots an old Oxford school chum and sits to partake of afternoon refreshments. Asking for they are out of trifle when the cakie (Waitress) comes to take his order. Alys informs him all the trifle has been sent to the palace for the upcoming Investiture Ceremonies (the queens bestowing of knighthood on an individual). Ceremonies Lord Hatbrook's man of business and Alys' father are partaking of. As they continue Michael realizes Alys is the young woman who caught his fancy outside earlier. When a rude patron causes Alys to nearly fall Michael saves her as he catches her and holds her upright. He is sorry to see the saucy serving girl leave.Alys listens to her sisters and mother discuss the other attendees to the Investiture. She spies the Marques across the room and wonders if he will recognize her in her finery as the cakie who had served him his tea the day before. Then she catches what her father is saying an is appalled that he is telling another nobleman that because she is 26 and has worked before he came to the notice of the queen and his station was raised he will be offering a rather large dowry to the man who marries his daughter. She can not believe he just announce he is willing to pay handsomely for someone to take her off his hands so that her younger sisters might have a better chance at a more titled match.Alys never wanted to get married. She enjoys working in the Teashop and making her specialty shops. She goes outside to keep from saying something to embarrass her father and her family. A few days later her father tells her she is to leave the shop and go home and act like the lady she now is. He has taken her one joy away from her. Then it gets worse he start offering her to his shop manager and then his second in command and then a third. Then Rose's asthma grows worse and she and Rose go to their new country estate for the cleaner air and better climate. Arriving only to find that the Estate is in total disrepair and liveable.Michael heads to his country Estate to take care of some business and with hopes of seeing the lovely Alys. With his brother in the background he can count him as his heir and thus enjoy some fun time with the enticing eldest daughter of Sir Redcake. Suffering one of his attacks as he gets of the train and starts walking to his home his luck is in when Alys's carriage comes across him. Getting him something to eat Alys takes him to her home at wich time Lord Hatbrook takes one look at the condition of the living quarters, the drafty rooms and lack of staff and quickly offers to have them stay at his home.This book starts a bit slow for the first four or five chapters so that the story background can be set up for the reader, but after that is goes very quickly and smoothly. I enjoyed watching the interactions and differences in the family members. The actions of Sir Redcake is quite common of the fathers of the era. As is the frowning of women of title working. As the story progresses we learn even more of the backgrounds of the characters. Both the heroine and hero have baggage to overcome. With the death of Lord Hatbrooks brother he feels the need to marry quickly and chooses Alys as his future bride. As with even couples today they must learn to adapt their ways and lives to include their spouses. This is always a difficult task and you must be willing to compromise. Something our lead characters have difficulty in doing.I admire Alys for her independence and willingness to go against convention. Although Lord Hatbrook thinks he is a progressive man he soon finds he is more traditional than he thought. The times may be changing but the question is can these two star-crossed lovers overcome an overbearing father, a harridan of a mother and family responsibilities to solidify their lives and attain their hearts desires. Ms. Hiestand is planning a second book soon and I will be looking for it two. She did a wonderful job with the first let us hope the second will continue the high standards she has set. A Delightful story to be enjoyed by all who read it. It is funny, bold and shows us family loyalty is neither an old or new concept, but rather one of the heart.

This one can be read as standalone but does contain interconnecting characters. This book started off really promising and I did enjoy several parts of it. But I do have to say that I thought that as good as this one started off, it went downhill from there. I wish that a few things had been done differently, but this one was still enjoyable and will be a good read for plenty of fans of the New Adult genre.After being tired of living in the shadow of her brothers and cousin, Beatriz Bia Fernandez leaves her family and their ranch in California and heads to Colorado to attend college. Although things start off well for Bia and her roommate, things quickly deteriorate as her roommate and her sorority sister friends quickly turn on her. Soon they are spreading rumors of Bia being a slut based off the fact that she is Brazilian and the fact that the boys they want are interested in Bia instead. Bia not only has to deal with the sorority girls, but several guys that won't stop hitting on her and assuming that she is the slut they have heard about. Garrett, the only guy that Bia is remotely interested in seems to be running hot and cold, and she has no idea what is going on with him. When she turns to her love of horses at a nearby ranch to help her get through, she comes across Garrett and finds out that not only does he work at the ranch but that his family owns it. Soon Bia and Garrett are getting closer as they share their love of horses and ranch work. But when secrets are revealed and the torture Bia has been subjected to worsen, Bia soon begins to wonder if she made the right choice going to Colorado or if she would be better off returning to California.I liked Garrett, but honestly it took awhile for me to really even see him as the love interest in this story. He wasn't even around for a good portion of the start, and by the time he was I felt like we had been introduced to several male characters that seemed to have been possibilities also. I did like him though and was able to warm up to him quickly. I thought that he acted strangely at times though, and although I knew there was more to him I felt like we never did get to really know him that well. He was a mystery for most of the story, and he ran so hot and cold I just got tired of waiting to see what he was up to. By the time we actually figured out what he was up to, I felt like the character we had come to know was so different from his real self. He should have been more honest with Bia, and it really upset me that he didn't open up to her more. Bia was made out to be self-sufficient and strong, and she showed some of that at times, but I felt for most of this story she was actually the exact opposite. She showed moments of weakness and ran easily, and she took way too much crap from others. I also felt like she show moments where she was tricked too easily and completely naive. I kept waiting for her to wake up, but it took much longer than I would have expected from such a smart girl. I felt like Bia and Garrett did have chemistry and they were passionate about the same things, but their relationship progressed far too slowly for my taste.Overall, I would say this one was enjoyable but fell short of being great. It was slow at times and didn't seem to be progressing at all at points. I felt like there wasn't a lot going on in the story for the majority of it except for there were a lot of people being stupid. I read a lot of NA books, and honestly these were some of the most close-minded and mean spirited immature kids I have ever read about. The worst part is the amount of people apparently afflicted by stupidity in this small college, and I just couldn't believe that that many people would continue without ever wising up. It got really old and just really made the story drag. Even Garrett had times where he gave in to the stupidity and would doubt Bia, despite knowing her better than almost anyone else in the story. I just didn't get it and it didn't work for me. I will also say that Beatriz being Brazilian while speaking in English for the most part, she did have a tendency to use Portuguese words. There is a dictionary at the beginning of the story, but without printing it out it got to be too much work to constantly flip to the front to try and figure out what she was saying. That got annoying to me and after awhile I just didn't care anymore. Those parts I would just guess what she was saying or move on if I couldn't figure out any clues from the text. I think that if you have read the first book in the series that you will enjoy this one and like seeing familiar characters. But if you are looking for a NA read that is new or different or has really deep characters and connections, this one probably isn't for you.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Xpresso Book Tours**","07 6, 2014",A1HAX9F7HY0D5V,Casey M.

The Christmas pageant they've sold 300 tickets for, has to be cancelled due to a measles outbreak. Even the orchestra that was lined up can't come. The Christmas pageant is the shelter's main fundraiser. Without the pageant the shelter is in danger of closing.The only solution is to try and put the pageant on with the help of the residents. A host of wonderful characters shine in this story. Pastor Steve and his secretary, Milly, and Stanley who used to be a resident of the shelter.But the characters who steal the show are the current-day residents, most of them scruffy, some of them smelling like a brewery. There's Charlie One-note with his wooden recorder, the tall thin guy with dreadlocks matted under a baseball cap who plays a battered saxophone, and Johnson and Peter JollyWhat a surprise to read a Christmas miracle, brought about by prayer and expecting God to step in when we're on the skids.","11 1, 2013",A22P5087NJW802,Christine Lindsay Award-winning Author of Sh...,An Unexpected Glory is an unexpected joy.,1383264000,0.0,False,5.0

Just seeing the word Omega in the title reminded me of the old Charlton Heston movie called The Omega Man, which is about a survivor in an apocalyptic setting. In that story the main character kills humanoid creatures that inhabit the Earth. However, this story is a little different and what's cool about the book Omega Zero is the back story that we are given before the apocalypse. The hero is a drifter named Trent, a former marine who's got to make a living anyway he can since he's too disturbed to get regular employment. So, he does a shady drug deal and is forced into hiding in the woods of the Appalachian Trails. When he comes out of hiding he finds that the people of the world appear to be all dead, with their corpses everywhere. This is something unique that you don't see in other stories. If there was an apocalypse there would have to be corpses everywhere. Having the streets be totally empty is unrealistic. This story is more realistic and I like that he meets up with a partner, Emily, along the way. If it were just one lone character the whole time it would get rather boring. I think the author, Ryan Henry, deserves credit for all the new twists he is bringing to this genre.This book jumps right into the action from page one and doesn't hold back on anything, including the language. I know some people get easily offended by fowl language, but I think it just adds to the realism of the story. People swear in real life and in situations like the protagonist is in, I'd be swearing all the time. I only wish that it wasn't such a short book because there is a lot that could have been done with this story line. But still, this book delivers an imaginative twist on the common post-apocalyptic genre.","05 30, 2013",A1NF0S5AROWPJ,Russell Lee,A fast paced story with interesting twists!,1369872000,1.0,True,5.0

She reminded me of the little girl that Shirley Temple played in that movie The Little Princess or her life did. Genevieve lived with this couple who had an inn type place that they ran. She had to get up early in the morning and help in the kitchen and then she had to help make the beds. She was working from daylight till dark. But then she got lucky when a couple of nuns stopped at the inn one night and decided to take her back with them to live at the abbey. With everything she had been through Genevieve decide that she was never going to have anything to do with men ever and the nuns at the abbey had been so good to her over the years that she wanted to be a nun herself. She was very happy as nun for a very long time until a new priest came to town. Genevieve and the priest fell in love with each other but they were not allowed to show or let anyone know how they felt about each because they had made their vows. But after a while and with all the bad things that was going on at the abbey they decided that the best thing for them to do was leave, sneak off in the middle of the night.Anne a young woman who lived in the present day and time had broken up with the man that she loved a while back.

So Anne and Neil go on a vacation. They get lost on the way to their hotel and spend the night in the mountains. They find an old abbey that has all but fell completely down.

This Kindle e-book was approximately 197 printed pages and sold for $4.99 at the time of writing this review.General theme (minor spoilers)This book completes the story of Amit that began in the first installment called Namaste (now called Vengeance). Amit, trained in the martial arts in a mountain monastery, is the master of his profession. But his mission of revenge for the murder of a young women/girl friend named Nisha is in direct conflict with the peaceful teachings and philosophy of the monastery where he's spent most of his life. His hunt takes him on a circuitous route around the globe where each stop leads to more strange and unexpected discoveries. This then is the conclusion to Amit's tale...Some thoughts on Namaste: The Whole Story...The Pros:1.) an exciting tale of revenge2.) many great encounters... most violent and graphically described.3.) well written with few if any grammatical or spelling errors.4.) I thought the tender love scene with Amit and Nisha in Chapter 23 was beautiful rendered. Also the entire end-sequence was skillfully crafted and was enhanced by an impeccable sense of pace and timing.5.) the actual plot and the unusual tangents that developed as things played out was brilliantly done.6.) a definitive and satisfying ending.The Cons:1.) Chapter 10, where Jason Alfero's hypochondria descriptions were a little overdone and maybe dragged out too long.2.) unbelievability... as per the following scene, in Amit's handling of travel concerns and his lack of documentation...'He ... decided to 'literally' hop onto a jet, springing onto the runway as it began takeoff, leaping up and grabbing it above one of its rear wheels'.Really guys! I know Amit's more than capable, but the lack of Oxygen, the cold and atmospheric pressure changes... meditation can only do so much... lol.3.) Amit's prolonged indecisiveness in the first 1/2 or so of the book... he seemed to be constantly at war with himself to justify his coarse of action. I find tales of prolonged indecision and indecisive in heroes tend to make for a difficult read. I simply get weary of listening to the circular thought process regarding their hang-ups.4.) there were many philosophical discussions early on between Amit and his mentor, Woo, regarding his spiritual and physical training that I just didn't comprehend and found quite long.Impression:A great first section (original first book) accompanying a truly gripping end-segment.However there where sections in the middle that made my wonder if the authors may have lost their focus or maybe were under some time constraints.

In typical Loucks style, there's a nice mixture of weird supernatural happenings and tense love story.The story centers on college student Alexis, who moves into a new apartment. Lo and behold, her next door neighbor is none other than Ian, her cute-as-heck lab partner who stood her up and never came back. Now that they're sharing the same building, the two of them find that their original chemistry is still very much alive. The thing they discover in the basement laundry room, however, is very much NOT.I love the way the haunting was described. It's not your usual bump in the night tale. The characters' emotions and visceral reactions felt very real as they struggled with trying to figure out what was haunting them while their attraction steamed up the pages.Like many novellas and short stories, though, it's difficult to pull off an entire plot and neatly tie it all up in the end without leaving bits of critical information out. That's what I missed here. The climax and reveal of who and what the haunting was all about needed expansion. Twenty, maybe thirty more pages could have done that and left me more satisfied when I reached the end.All in all, Haunted Chemistry is a good quick read, coming in at at little over 100 Kindle pages. As opposed to Ms. Loucks's first YA book, The Grave Winner, this one is decidedly new adult, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 17/18.

Did you know that on 14 April 1967, 21-year old Billy Rohr of the Boston Red Sox made his MLB debut in Yankee Stadium?  In a memorable game the left-handed pitcher came within one out of pitching a no-hitter.  A single to the left, with two outs in the ninth, from the Yankees' Elston Howard spoiled what would have been a historic moment for the rookie.  Indeed, to their credit the Yankee fans booed when their own man broke up Rohr's no-no on a 3-2 pitch.  Remarkably, Rohr pitched with an injured knee after getting hit with a line drive in the sixth inning.  In the end he had to settle for a one hit shutout and a 3-0 win for the Sox.

864807,B00J1SGHWW,"[0, 0]",5,"Ahhhhh FINALLY Garrett's story has come! I have been waiting for his story for for-ever!Unconditional was proof that good things come to those that wait. Unlike the previous books in the series, Garrett and Carina didn't have a history together, they met for the first time at Emerson  Juliet's wedding nothing happened since Carina was engaged. They had instant animosity and disgust for each other, so you know that means we're going to have a great time seeing them fight their feelings. I think what makes Unconditional my favorite is that Melody did a few things differently here. While we still get a sexy, angsty read, we have two characters with no real prior connections, and they were hurt by different people in their pasts. Up til now we didn't really know much about Garrett except for him having a different girl every night, and we only knew what Juliet has told us about Carina. They are SO MUCH MORE than what I thought they would be! I never liked Carina in the earlier books, I thought she was a selfish B, yet after getting to know her I realized I judged her unfairly. Yes, she admits she was selfish but after hearing her story, I can understand her actions. *Whispers* I really like her now. She didn't have it as easy as I thought and I found myself feeling bad for her and the things she went through. There's one situation Carina finds herself in as an adult and I have to say Melody did a great job handling it delicately and with sensitivity, this happens fairly early on in the story. Garrett's back story surprised me, It wasn't what I was expecting at all so kudos Melody! I loved watching them push each others buttons, call each other out on their BS, yet be there for the other when they needed a friend. There were a few things I didn't see coming and a few I had hoped to see, I was giggly happy when what I hoped for happened. Unconditional had just enough angst to make me hold my breath and clutch my chest yet leave me excitedly happy at the end. As I said earlier, this is the best one so far and I can NOT wait for the next one. I'm convinced Beachwood Bay is a magical place you can always go back to when you need a second chance to get things right.

Trolson states that he did in-depth research on all aspects of the book including the 'blood business', Caneleno Indians, and police procedurals which is very evident once you delve into the book. In a story featuring a cop and a vampire in a love triangle with a female archaeologist, it's fairly imperative to be well-schooled in such diverse topics and Trolson did his homework. Reese, the cop, Rusty, the archaelogist, and Ajax Rasmussen, as the vampire, were very realistic and entertaining characters that brought life to a very creepy plot. This horror/thriller/romance puts Trolson on a level with Stephen King. A four star read for me!","04 28, 2014",A2EV3N41P9APR9,Cindi Clubbs,Creepy and riveting,1398643200,0.0,False,4.0

What I loved most about the book is that after all of the all too human vampires of the last few years we are finally getting a dose of some good ones.If you love police procedural novels and vampires you are in for a real treat. Trolson gives us the best of both. The characters are believable and his story is too. What if there were vampires today? What would they be like?

I felt sorry for Precious, Plum and Mark because sometimes situations in life make you make impulsive decisions instead of sitting down and figuring out a way to do things right. Reading about Plum really mad me sad because I see so many young girls like her in life and I just wish it was more I could do to reach out to some of them and let them know there is so much more out in the world besides bad boys, sex and bs. With Precious it made me think of the saying Never judge a book by its cover, you never know why people are doing things they do but most times it is a reason that is much deeper than we think, as was the case with her. There are also so many dudes like Akeim in the world, I wish people would take more time out and explain to their daughters and sons the importance of safe sex. Even though what Mark was doing was wrong, I felt bad for him also because that is probably the only way he saw to get himself and his family out of hood which is the case of many young black men. I really enjoyed reading this story and hope that many more will read it and learn some things while reading it.

40097,B004HILPPU,"[1, 1]",5,"When I read William Meikle's The Watchers Omnibus, I absolutely loved it. I have, whenever possible, come back to this author time and again for some real horror entertainment.Looking through Meikle's catalogue of work, I was attracted to Eldren: The Book of the Dark...As soon as I started reading, I was shocked... and disappointed. I had read Meikle's opening scene for Eldren before, submitted as a short story for Best New Vampire Tales Vol I. and once I read on, I was left wondering why it had been included. However, Meikle, ever the storyteller, later weaves this tale into the Eldren yarn, creating a very satisfying addition to the story indeed.Although Eldren could be considered typical of Meikle's work, with an action horror feel to it, for me, it is distinctly darker in tone than much of the author's work that I have read to date. As is his style, Meikle takes the reality of Scotland and skews it believably to incorporate a significant horror aspect. Eldren reminded me of a combination of Salem's Lot and 30 Days of Night... this is definitely not a bad thing. Where Stephen King has Castle Rock, Meikle has Finsburgh, a town in the South West of Scotland that is suffering from the decline of industry in the area and unaware of the evil nestling at its heart.Additionally, Meikle adds a meaty back story for his creatures of the night. I am not spoiling this title for you by telling you, since it is alluded to in the synopsis, but Meikle's vampires were created before man, and received their vampiric ten commandments before Moses ascended Mount Sinai.For those looking for anti-heroes or sullen vampires lamenting their dark gift, I'd suggest this book isn't for you. Eldren is filled with very believable characters: bullied schoolchildren, alcoholics, overwhelmed teachers not to mention a vengeful vampire hunter, ancient creatures of the night and zombie-like bloodsuckers too!Much big-screen horror relies heavily on CGI and big set pieces these days. Such sets are only limited in literary form by the limits of the writer's own imagination. However, with Eldren, Meikle doesn't go for the Hollywood approach, instead, favouring the fear of what lies in the dark, lurking, just waiting. That is not to say that Eldren is without some grand twisted scenes: the vampire's lair and the Hansen House are undeniably noteworthy creations from Meikle, ranking in my mind along with the author's dark visions of Linlithgow Palace and Edinburgh Castle in The Watchers Omnibus.Meikle is part of the thin red line, continuing to defend all that is sacred and holy (or unholy) about the subgenre from the assault of angsty sparkly vampires and the Dawson's Creek type nonsense that comes along with them. Neither does he employ the foppish vamps favoured by many writers in the genre. The villains of Eldren are evil: pure and simple. Mankind is cattle and all they wish to do is feed on them. Meikle's ancient vampires also have the ability to enslave minds to a degree, enabling them to entrance their victims before feasting on them a nice touch which for me, harks back to the classic vampires I grew up reading about and watching in one too many late-night Hammer films.Despite its modern setting, Eldren feels like a good old fashioned horror tale. The protagonists are clearly defined, the villains of the piece are entirely without remorse and the author weaves his characters and plot together seamlessly, allowing the story to flow well, drawing towards the big finale...Eldren is pulpy horror entertainment at its best. Engaging, pacy and classic this should definitely make its way on to your reading list.","11 6, 2012",AAU5MAMZRRR80,John Milton,Salem's Lot comes to Scotland!,1352160000,1.0,True,5.0

She had a harsh childhood of abuse from her father and later on a boyfriend that Philip saved her from but led to his overprotectiveness.  He swore to keep her safe which has led to a nun-like existance for a 26-year-old woman.  The only moments of true freedom for her are when she's dancing and the attraction she feels towards Philip's lawyer, Drew.  Her past and her obligation to her brother has held her back though.  Deciding to open a dance has bolstered her confidence and she finally goes after Drew wholeheartedly in a sensual yet naively planned out seduction.  Rose was a sweet character who just wanted to grow up.  Her brother saved her but is smothering her and keeping her from a happy future out of fear.  I applaud her strength and ached for her when a silly roadblock puts her HEA in jeopardy.Drew is a strong and sexy man who at first loved the challenge of working on Philip's questionable deeds.  He sometimes had to work in the grey areas to see Philip succeed but has come to realize how dangerous it really is.  He's been attracted to Rose for a long time but didn't feel she was ready to have a relationship with him.  Her sensual show in front of the window has him seeing her as an adult which unleashes him to seduce her in a slow build-up of sexual tension-filled moments.  We unfortunately don't get a deep understanding of Drew in this story.  I found him admirable but not very compelling.Who I continue to find compelling is Philip!  He's mysterious with questionable ethics but I find myself drawn to him even more as the series progresses.  We get to see another layer of him in his over-protectiveness of Rose.  His actions are out of love but they take away free will.  He's a control freak who wants to control everything and play people as chess pieces to make his life easier.  Even with these faults I'm dying for his story to be told as I find him an utterly fascinating multifaceted character!This story was enjoyable yet not as intense or deep as the previous installments.  Rose had a rough upbringing but not near as traumatic as the rest of the heroines in this series.  The roadblock to their HEA was casually inserted and quickly dealt with behind the scenes.  The sexual interludes were hot but not as impactful considering how quickly the protagonists came together.

None of it compared to being forced to wait for you to come back to me.4.5 StarsWell color me surprised! You never know what you're going to get when offered a read-for-review book. Since I was recently lamenting the lack of good new Romantic Suspense authors, the offer from Mrs. Stelmack seemed serendipitous ))From page one, this book is packed with action, intrigue, sexual tension, and edge of your seat moments. And yet somewhere amid the chaos is a wonderful love story, between two deserving people.My Synopsis:Delta Fox (come one, can a name be ANY more kick ass?!) comes from a sad and lonely background. Betrayed in the worst possible way by her parents, she spent her teenage years being trained in the art of stealth by her mentor and pseudo father figure, Mr. Hadrian. When her one and only friend is murdered and people start chasing Delta, she doesn't simply try to get away...she wants to get even. Delta doesn't have special people in her life, and the ones who took her friend need to be brought to justice. Problem is, Delta is a thief. Sure, she only steals things from those that were originally stolen, so she's not technically breaking the law. Nevertheless, there have been enough run ins with cops and bad guys that she has a warrant out for her arrest. So she must stay hidden.Brian is a thrill seeking stuntman and owner of a special effects studio Cause  FX. He's no stranger to danger...in fact, he actively seeks it out. When he comes across a lone woman hitchhiker in the pouring rain on the highway late at night, he has no idea that he's about to be led on a merry chase with more thrills and danger than he'd bargained for. Not to mention, the cute little ninja like woman he picked up is sexy as hell and pushes all the right buttons.Within a day of Delta and Brian's first meeting, there are car chases and shootings, smashed limbs and assassination attempts. Boy, does this author know how to write action! I have missed this genre, although I have to say that it focuses less on the sexual aspect and tension than my normal Navy SEAL stories or FBI macho men romances. And yet somehow, the love story between Delta and Brian is very genuine, somewhat slow building, (although the time line is still very small, so much happens that it feels longer).My Thoughts:Brian is exactly what Delta needs. He sees a sweet, pixie like woman beneath her tough girl exterior. He uncovers her vulnerabilities. Here's what he says when he learns of her past:But you beat them, didn't you? They betrayed you in the worst way a person can be betrayed, but you didn't lie down and die. You found your wn path in one of the toughest cities on Earth. You foj d friends and a mentor and became this ninja, wall climbing super-thief...You're a hero, Delta...Ummm...Swoon! Yes, yes, I swooned!!Aside from the fabulous suspense and action that this book contained, I loved most watching how Delta is slowly won over by Brian. He's steadfast when that's what she needs most. She changes from a loner woman, stoic and simply living day to day to a woman who loves, desires, giggles, and truly LIVES her life, for the FIRST time in her life. It was beautiful! And it made me smile while giving me warm fuzzies! When they finally reach the point of playful and fun with each other was the highlight of the book for me! I love how Delta goes from frightened and mistrustful to letting loose a round of giggles.I'm not most women. And before he could correct the stupidity of that remark, she keeled over sideways onto the bed and was giggling like a madwoman, making the mattress jiggle. He whacked her one with a pillow...This was the ultimate man who knows EXACTLY how to handle the strong willed Delta. And boy, does Delta ever need someone to show her tenderness and devotion! My favorite Brian quote:Use my love. You need to wear it when you're cold. Turn it on when the room's too quiet. Read it when you're bored. Pop it back when you're sick. Call it when you're in trouble...Take it, Delta. Take mine, take it all.She swallowed. I've got nothing to give in return.Nothing at all?She knew what he wanted. He knew how to love somebody. She'd get it wrong, she didn't know how to love. You don't want my love. It's small. And hard. And poky.A remarkably full debut novel from this husband and wife writing team. I'm very much looking forward to the next installment featuring Brian's quirky, off the wall assistant Gina.My HUGE thanks to the author for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

265354,B008N5TI66,"[2, 2]",4,"I was cruising for vampire gay books (checking out the competition) on Amazon-Kindle, and was surprised at how relatively few there were. I tried a couple which I hated, but I really enjoyed Tia Fielding's Technically Dead.Set in Atlanta, Fielding's romance adopts the post-Charlaine Harris trope of vampires being part of the general culture. It is very nicely done, and the background story is worked into the narrative neatly and efficiently.The main character, Bran, works as a counselor for low pay but high gratification at a homeless shelter for throwaways: teenagers--both vampire and human--who have been tossed out by their families, as he himself was at nineteen. His long personal history with vampires, and the beautifully described tattoo that he wears, are intertwined, so to speak.His friendships, his sex life, his work ethic, his inner sadness are all laid out for us elegantly and convincingly. Bran is a great character beautifully painted for the reader.Heath, the old-old vampire (you'll see), is not depicted with quite that level of finesse and depth, although we do learn his history. His story is, ultimately, a touching one, but I was slightly disappointed that he didn't get the kind of depth we got for Bran--maybe it's just my perception. The essentials are all there, don't get me wrong, but it was such an interesting story, I wanted more to really get him.I really enjoyed this book, and, as I find more and more true these days, liked the fact that the sex was not about sex, but about the characters' connections. There is emotional heft to the interrelationships of these people's lives. Again, with a surprising economy, Fielding clarifies the various connections without overexplaining or killing the real feelings. It's a good plot, which I felt could have been elaborated--there's no reason the book couldn't have been longer, richer.The Epilogue (often my favorite part, I like my epilogues) sort of disappointed me. It wasn't bad, honestly, but just felt a little flat, when so much of the book was so replete with everything I like best in a romance. All that said, if Fielding ever writes a sequel about Bran and Heath, I'll buy it. They're worth another look.","09 7, 2012",A2FZ85EIAJWYBC,Ulysses Dietz,A really good gay vampire romance--we need more of these.,1346976000,1.0,True,4.0

447667,B00BN1LL2G,"[0, 0]",4,"This book was conceptualized with a purpose: to bring the effect of intertwined relationships realistically to the fore. Persons dating have inter-relationship issues with which each of us can relate to. In the search for love we go through phases of guilt, doubts, expectancies, one night stands, betrayal, compromise, soul-searching, mistaking of emotions, juggling of commitment to work and love, not being able to connect, vulnerability, blame, ailing relationships, physical attraction, misunderstandings, flirting, jealousy, etc.The question arises of how to deal with such emotions. The reader can learn through the faults and mistakes of the protagonists how to deal with such matters in order to have positive consequences. In any relationship we seek love, hope for a better future, understanding, compatibility, freedom and safety : a sanctuary for body, heart and soul. Will Lauren, our heroine achieve that and with whom?The story takes us through many celebrations and gifting, but not through the crucial expression of true love and the celebration thereof. That is left for a sequel.The title revolves around the physical happening of drunken-driving. Lauren's mother was a victim and killed as result thereof. Matthew who intoxicates her emotionally, was convicted for drunken-driving and served a sentence and needs to face his demons before he can get rid of them. Lauren's crush on the man of her dreams intoxicates her. A mere brush of his shoulder is intoxicating.Compliments to the author, Alicia Renee Kline for a well-developed story. It is an outpour of intoxicating issues that constitutes the life of the dating. She focusses on real life issues. With the title of the book, she underlines how intoxicated you can be when you search for love, when you are not home in the arms of a soulmate. I am sure we will see that happening in the follow-up.","06 5, 2014",A2OUKYJRIV2ACT,Amazon Customer,Review by Scarlett Jensen of Intoxicated by Alicia Renee Kline,1401926400,0.0,False,4.0

In this final installment, we get to discover more truth and experience more pain as the characters work towards emotional freedom. This is a heart-wrenching story about love, loss and moving on from the unbearable pain we inflict on the people we are supposed to love.Denver has been used, she has used and believes she is not worthy of much more than her empty life. It takes Ransom to make her believe that she deserve better than an unhealthy, toxic relationship with someone. She is at rock bottom when he picks her up and helps her move towards her self-discovery. He is there every step of the way as she is able to identify her self-worth.Ransom finds out who is guilty in Denver8217s date rape from the first book (Used). From that point, protecting Denver is his number one priority. Ransom is many things, including pigheaded, cocky and uncompromising. However, he uses these to form a protective barrier around Denver and make her feel safe. On the other side, we see a very tender Ransom that once he lets himself love he knows that it will be forever. He stops at nothing to show Denver that his heart is completely and utterly owned by her, his 8216little fighter8217.In Freed, we find out just how much the relationship between Ransom and Denver can take. We experience an ex-girlfriend, a very sick parent, unknown half-siblings and many other surprises along the way. Ransom shows his compassionate side that makes us fall further in love with this bad boy of rodeo.This book is written in alternative POVs between Denver and Ransom. Since both characters were experiencing a lot of emotional turmoil, the alternative POVs really played out well in the story. One of the things we loved the most is that we were able to really connect emotionally with the characters. It is a tearjerker at times, but ends as a HEA. Once you start this one, you will not be able to put it down.

47299,B004NIFWOO,"[1, 1]",4,"This novella was added onto one of TW Brown's DEAD zombie novels downloaded for a Kindle reader - presumably as a sales promotion feebie for other Ava series. Since this is not the sort of read I'd normally consider planking down money to obtain, this counts as very smart move by whoever thought of this promotional wheeze.As a very light read Ava's adventures work well.  There's nothing deep-and-meaningful in her pages.  One day Ava, loser 30-something, loses hope but miraculously embarks on a new life as a flesh eating ghoul. That's right, she eats living human flesh...of certain types and qualities of provenance.  Right from the off, these stories are fueled by Ava's very funny and entertaining snarky perspectives on herself, the environments and characters she encounters.  Take these zingers away and the work would flop.  To this extent, Ava's genetic code draws heavily on the words and phrasing of cynical takes on life's condition put out there by Micky Spillane and cross-bred with those of Philip Marlowe.There's one little tinkling inconsistency here, I think, in the sense that Ava is 32 years old but comes across at times more like a precocious young woman ten years younger..but, not to matter, it clicks okay.  Perhaps at root Ava has always been a bit of a loose unit in terms of her social maturity?  If so, it's part of her charm and relatability.As mentioned, I liked the way Ava was wrapped in as a bonus value deal packaged with a more heavy-weight novel. It worked. I'm giving serious consideration to putting Ava on my Kindle shopping list and want to complement Mr Brown for having more than one string to his DEAD zombie wordsmithing powers - impressive and compelling as they are.Key words:  Funny, Engaging, Fast-moving, Original, Relatable, Diverting.

It was gifted to me for an honest review.Arianna was in a long term relationship with Justin, who unexpectedly leaves her for another woman he has been seeing behind Arianna's back. He wipes out their joint banking account which leaves Arianna broke and wondering how she is going to keep ahead. She is a hard working young woman who owns her own art gallery.Ben is a workaholic who is almost killed in an accident at work. He is put in a coma to help him recover and is alive by a miracle after a fall that should have killed him. His long time girlfriend does not stick around to help him and that makes him not want to become involved with anyone anytime soon. Ben has a dog that is his best friend, Charlie. Charlie can sense when things are not alright with Ben.Tristan who is Ben's brother also has been hurt in love. The love of his life was killed years ago when a car hit her and killed her instantly. After this Tristan won't give his heart to anyone again. He just dates several women but is not happy with his life.Ben goes to an art show at Arianna's art gallery and there is an instant connection between the two. He went to buy a painting for his apartment never expecting to find Arianna who is smitten with him from the start too. They start seeing each other and end up falling deeply in love. Ben introduces Arianna to his brother. Tristan has deep feelings for Arianna. But he loves his brother and keeps his feelings to himself.Arianna gets a big surprise, little does she know so does Ben. When Arianna calls Ben to let him know her big news she can't get through. She is afraid then that maybe he is not interested in her any longer. Tristan goes to Ben's apartment to see what is going on and gets the surprise of his life.This book is a dear, sweet, loving, at times heartbreaking story. It is one of those that you don't want to put down until you find out what is going to happen between Ben, Tristan and Arianna. When one of them gets the worst news ever the other two will have to be there for them no matter what.It made me laugh in parts and cry tears of sadness in others.

I just regret that I started reading it too late at night and stayed up until 4:00 a.m. and hadn't finished it yet.Alysin Sin for short, takes dinner to her boyfriend's office and catches him with his secretary.  Instead of a typical reaction, she handles it with grace and dignity.  When she leaves his office, she calls her best friend, Jolie. To regroup they go on a little journey, a cruise to be exact.  On this cruise, Sin meets an amazing man who pretends to be her husband when a jerk tries hitting on her. This is when the adventure and fun begins.They meet again later and he takes her to a jewelry store on the ship, buys a ring, and proposes to her.  He wants her to be his pretend wife for the remainder of the cruise. He wants the whole marriage package, sex, sleeping together, meals, even the mundane.  They make an agreement to not share personal information...no names, no addresses, no phone numbers...nothing personal so they cannot contact each other after the cruise is over.I have to say that I fell in love with Mr. Bedroom Eyes, Mr. BE for short.  He is sexy, romantic, and throw in some good sex and what girl wouldn't fall for him.  Even her friend, Jolie likes him.I would highly recommend this for anyone that loves erotica with a love story twist.  To be honest, I didn't really see the storyline going the way it did in the beginning.  I was pleasantly surprised just a couple of chapters into the book.  I've read a lot of erotica so some of the scenes didn't bother me, but for some people some of the scenes might make them a little uncomfortable. There is some girl/girl action, menage, and one scene that involves Sin, Mr. BE, and another couple.I am now anxiously awaiting Sin in Vegas.","07 6, 2013",A3UZFOONG4D2AL,gingersnap,Scorching,1373068800,1.0,True,5.0

Max is Specimen 278, and he's a gene-spliced Venus fly trap, a deadly, carnivorous plant capable of biting off human arms and legs. While Max is not human and is very much a plant rooted in the soil, he does have feelings and thoughts. He actually wishes that he were capable of communicating with his creator, Dr. Prethorius, the diabolical, mad scientist who sing-songs his way through gory death and carnage, be it that of plant or human.One day, the doctor moves Jenny, Specimen 313, into the greenhouse, planting her right beside Max. With the musically inclined and unbalanced doctor in charge and with plants cultivated to crave human flesh, anything can happen in this greenhouse. And even stranger things can happen when these man-eating plants start to communicate with each other and become friends.This story has 244 locations and is part of the anthologyThe Monster's Corner: Stories Through Inhuman Eyes. It's a quick read, strange but interesting, as it combines an almost campy horror movie feel with some disturbing scenes of blood and gore. I don't think I've ever read a story from a killer plant's point of view, but I very much enjoyed this one.

At first Leigh's a bit skittish, but soon Jared's dominance takes over and he pulls her into him for fun and sensuality.What neither expected was to find in each other more than just a casual fling.  Then he introduces her to his sometime roommate and lover, Matteo. Jared's a photojournalist and is always hopping around to locales for his assignments. Matteo is a musician and he's also rarely around. But when the two men are together, they hang out as friends do, or have sex. So when Matteo arrives in town Jared introduces him to Leigh, in hopes that she'll be willing to share both of them.For the next month, the threesome have fun filled days and scorching nights. Then it's time for the two men to leave for their jobs and Leigh realizes she has to say goodbye. She's found in them, especially Jared, more than just a tryst, but can do nothing but give them their freedom and walk away from the best time of her life.Summer Solstice is just the ticket for these hot summer nights.

Monster in My Closet had a lot of different things going on. From Zoey learning being able to read people's emotions was not a normal occurrence to seeing closet monsters and fairies. If that wasn't enough she also had to deal with an evil demon feeding off of brides. However even with all that being said the book didn't capture my interest and I can't quite put my finger on why. Normally once I start a book I finish it within a day or two this one took me roughly four days. I just kept putting it down.

812856,B00I6M0YFK,"[0, 0]",5,"- I received this novel as an ARC from the author, with no expectations or incentive other than to offer an honest, fair review. -Just so nobody picks up this book laboring under a misconception - the summary of Elfineness represents every page of the story.Yes, 300+ pages that read like an epic poem.Predominately, Elfineness is a paranormal romance featuring vampires however, it makes allusions and reference to scifi tech, mythology, faeries and other such fantastical staples that it is a melting pot of imagination. Tatyana Varenko deserves five stars if only for the creative courage it takes an author to address so many genres in an antiquated style.Would I expect Elfineness to be a mainstream success, like Twilight of The Vampire Chronicles?Unlikely.This is not dismissing the merits of Elfineness so much as acknowledging them. The book's implementation is such a novel, artistic approach that I'm not certain readers en mass would have the inclination or disposition to read a poetic paranormal romance, though I sincerely hope to be proven wrong.That said, Elfineness could be the type of book with an underground niche or cult following. In all likelihood it will be the first, last and only novel fans of paranormal romance will read that endeavors to be so - literally - poetic and old-fashioned.Students might be more enthusiastic about their homework if a literature teacher assigned something like this as required reading.

I was all ready to be mad at Damen and watch him squirm, but by the end of the book I just wanted to hold him. How in the world did that happen? I still don8217t know. I was mad then I was sad my emotions gave me whiplash.I will come back to Mairi and Damen in a minute, but I gotta talk about Alina and Drake. Now Alina, the ex-fiance, I really had no feelings toward her because to me she was unimportant. BUT NOW! I dislike that girl with a passion of a thousand suns! (That8217s right a thousand!) She made an impossible situation more difficult for both Mairi and Damen. Why does she do this you ask? Because now she decides she wants Damen: the loving and caring Damen that Mairi created with her love.Now Drake, what the hell! At first, I thought his plan of getting Mairi over Damen was clever yet tricky, but now I think he8217s creating more drama then necessary. Drake has a history of falling in love his clients therefore, maybe he should only take men clients or just act professionally. Between Drake and Alina, I wonder how Damen and Mairi will ever get their relationship back.And last, but definitely not least, Damen and Mairi. We see drastic changes in both characters: one for the better and the other not. Damen has let his love and guilt for Mairi help him change into a more understanding and loving person. He now knows what love is and he is not willing to let it or Mairi go. But is he too late?Mairi on the other hand is trying to harden her heart from Damen with a little help from Drake. Mairi was kept away from the media so doesn8217t know what Damen has been going through or how he has changed. Will it make a difference to Mairi? Will she move on with Drake?All I know is at the end of this book, I almost had nervous breakdown just like8230uhmmmm8230 gotta read the book to find out.","03 10, 2014",A1YOL46RXBYPDN,Juli,Need Book 5!!!,1394409600,0.0,True,4.0

Jenifer has had an abusive relationship in the past which causes her to have trust issues. Her trust issues keep her away from relationships, which causes her to feel lonely at times.One hell of a morning, with a car crash, spilled coffee, and being late for work changes everything. Her s***ty morning has its perks, meeting Aiden O'Connell.Aiden O'Connell is great looking, rich, and a sweet talker. He works for the largest financial corporation in the area, which happens to be owned by his father. He spends the majority of his time working hard. When this chance encounter of meeting Jenifer occurs he doesn't want it to slip by. He uses his charm and humor to earn a date from her.Aiden and Jenifer starts dating, after Jenifer gets some of her insecurities in check. The two fall for each other rather quickly. Everything in their relationship is perfect until an issue at Aiden's job puts him into an investigation for a serious crime. This investigation puts a little strain on their relationship and Jenifer is feeling insecure about her trust in Aiden.I really enjoyed this book. Once I started I didn't want to stop. The ending was a shock to me, I didn't see that coming. I finished this book at 2am and seriously considered starting the next one to see what happens next. Aiden is definitely sitting in the higher ranks on my book boyfriend list. Here lately I have been reading about rich, arrogant, dominating men (which I also like), so it was refreshing meeting someone like Aiden. Jenifer could be oversensitive at times but I still liked her character a lot.

Not sure of where his next meal is coming from and without a home, he takes a job at the Chicken Ranch working as a prostitute. Pride didn't make him any less homeless or fill the empty ache of a stomach that had gone too long without sustenance.Killian is an accountant with a steady job and home. But he his lacking something in his life and a one-off, spur of the moment visit leads him to Declan.I like the way both characters are portrayed, particularly Declan. I felt very sympathetic towards his situation.Declan is proud and doesn't accept his situation. He looks for ways to give himself the life he desires including taking classes to gain qualifications. But he struggles to come to terms with the life he has made at the Chicken Ranch and doesn't feel worthy of Killian. He is waiting for something bad to happen. If his own father couldn't love him, what hope did he have of finding someone who could?When things don't go smoothly, Declan almost believes this is what he deserves. The bad thing was, he wasn't even sure he had a right to be mad. After all, he was a whore.It was a big plus that even though Declan works at the Chicken Ranch, this book didn't spend too much time focusing on happenings at the brothel. It was more focused on the development of the romantic relationship between the two men.I loved the slow and steady approach Killian took to their physical relationship and how much Declan appreciated sex with Killian. Even though he worked in the sex trade, simple kisses with Killian had Declan waiting in anticipation. Thankfully, he found the prospect of being with Killian completely different than work. The act was the same, but the purpose behind it was not. and This wasn't just about sex. The actions were similar, but the level of intimacy was as diverse as night from day.My only actual dislike with this story was the use of a couple of words which I personally find a bit of a turn-off: ....Grave's tool.

820639,B00IB32REK,"[0, 0]",4,"For a first novella, The 9 Minute Thing is a great read. The author touts it as a witty story, and there are parts that made me smile and a few that made me laugh. That's a good thing. I like it when an author promises you something and delivers it. She also claimed kink and she delivered, though it was mild kink, so you won't get your shorts too tightly knotted.I love erotica but I'm not normally a D/s lifestyle sub-genre reader. I prefer D/s as a sexual fantasy, roll playing part of a larger erotic plot. But this story intrigued me from the Description here on Amazon and the tickler that I read. What struck me first was that it was well written. So I bought it, even though it's over my self proclaimed $0.99 budget for first time erotica authors. ) I must admit it was worth it.Here's the key to why I enjoyed this D/s story over many others that I've read. In classic D/s plots, psychological retraining, as well as kinky sexual demands, is often harsh or even brutal. Sorry, don't care for it. The plot Ms. May developed seduced you into the psychological alteration in a delightful way. I knew it was happening, because it had to be for what Gillian was willing to submit to, but it was subtle until it was clarified late in the story and you fully understood what Blake's intentions were.The other major draw with this story is, it isn't a billionaire with a screwed up personality, dominating a Vargas girl who didn't know she could enjoy humiliating submission so much. Ms. May picked a reasonably plain protagonist, albeit with a dark, kinky soul perhaps, although we never really learn a whole lot about his personality, a minor drawback in my estimation, and an older woman. I'll readily admit, I'm a sucker for this reverse cultural love story plot. I've found it in several other books I've read and I enjoy it. It is a difficult plot to pull off well, without degenerating into Mrs. Robinson. Ms. May did a commendable job handling the age difference giving us a believable story.I won't spoil the actual ending, but I've got a sneaky hunch, there's a sequel in the offing, although it might be a bit difficult to pull off successfully, considering the age difference. Best wishes Ms. May in your writing career and I look forward to reading more of your stories ... as long as they're erotic, kinky and wet.","03 12, 2014",A1HEMZF1BV4UMI,Amazon Customer,Very nicely done for first erotic story - Yes I laughed,1394582400,0.0,False,4.0

I am actually wondering how to get my hands on the next one in the series to review now that I have finished the first one. I absolutely loved Auburdeen's character. She is a young and impulsive witch whose instincts are stronger than her own self-importance. She jumps into things without thinking of what it could mean for her and definitely attracts a lot of danger and excitement. What is funny is that apparently her mother was the same way at her age. Why is that funny? Well Burdie (as she likes to be called) is sent to stay with her mom's old best friend in London and really expects that she will learn a lot of dirt on what her mom did back then. She also expects to be able to have those same experiences since Georgina (her mom's best friend) was involved in all those activities as well. Her mom even sends a letter to George (as she tends to be called) telling her that she hopes their daughters can be friends like they used to be. You are led to believe that the two girls might get to have some real life experiences and come to realize how sheltered the London Coven's lives really are. George has instead taken on the attitude that what she did when she was younger is not anything appropriate for a 16 year old to do in this age. This means Burdie is confined and bored. As you can expect, a bored teenager goes looking for excitement and that is exactly what she finds. Her world comes crashing down around her. You are left wondering how Burdie will ever get her life back to normal or IF she ever will. It has an amazing cliffhanger.

Initially, due mainly to this factor, I was all set to not like it. Still, I kept reading and I did enjoy it for the most part, despite it8217s similarities to the aforementioned book. It8217s an exciting and tense read, although I found it unsurprising in it8217s execution and conclusion.There were some things that I enjoyed. The blend of religion and action, for instance, worked well. I liked several of the biblical references to Revelation and their translation into the modern world. I also liked that, unlike the Da Vinci Code, this book focused on the end of days, not just the discovery of the Holy Grail. This saved it from being a copycat book and an actual original work.This book is plot driven and the plot worked well for the most part. There were a few plot holes and I did question character motivation occasionally too. And this is probably where I had my biggest issue with the book. We have Greg, who is somehow able to take a break from his job and spend all his time researching the Knight8217s Templar.

613895,B00EGJ3Q,"[1, 1]",4,"Rating:4.5 StarsIt took one failed marriage, a broken heart and a heart-breaking album for indie singer Jane Black to make it and earn the Grammy. After her post win-euphoria, gaining a large number of fans and story-hungry press, she can already feel the pressure for her to make a next big-hit album. It may took only a few days to finish the last hit album inspired by her ex-husband's abandonment, what will it take for her to make the next one? Her love life has been on hold, she hasn't dated - no thanks to the self-esteem blow given by Aidan after he left. But when the British (I can totally hear his accent!) music journalist, Matthew Harrigan asks her for an interview, she agreed, provided her private life would be off limits.Who doesn't want to hear the sexy accent coming from an English man? I totally understand Jane why she felt attracted to him. He's sexy, handsome, smart - but one problem lies: he's a journalist. What makes her so sure that he wasn't using her to get a story?She wasn't prepared for heartbreak, so no matter how tempting Matthew might be, she must tread carefully. But as they spend more time together, the chemistry is about to blow out of proportion and the attraction could no longer be denied. Did I mention she's suffering from a writer's block??? Just as when her love life is about to soar high, her career is about to plummet if she can't make a song before the deadline hits.Heartbreak is one of the most painful emotions people experience in life. One way to survive it (besides eating tons of ice cream) would be music. Jane Black had put all her emotions, frustrations, and anger in one album that instantly made wonders in the music industry. But what others don't know, it is not just her heart that was broken - it was her self-esteem as well. For someone who is intelligent, she didn't see that one coming. She felt embarrassed for being stupid, for not realizing things about Aidan earlier in their relationship. I understand her frustrations and her being careful in dealing with Matthew - he may be hot, but he's a journalist, and it's their work to dig up anything interesting about their subjects. Subject like her ex-husband is definitely interesting, but it was something she wouldn't want to discuss with anyone. Trust is hard to give, most especially when the person you have trusted the most has already broken it. It took Matthew a lot of effort before she opened up, there were a lot of bumps and dramas in their relationship, a lot of misunderstanding because of the trust issues, but in the end, they both got what they wanted. I so love the changes that Matthew had done to her self-esteem - it wasn't an easy feat. But he had done it with flying colors. Indeed, love, whether it made or broke you, can make things possible.I am powerful. I am sexy. I am beautiful. To a man. To the man I want.Let me start with the cover - the red bra says it all!!! Sexy and captivating. The plot was great, the chemistry was overwhelming I think my Kindle would have combusted anytime, the steamy scenes were HOT and of course, the characters were likable, but wished I had Matthew's POV too! (It would have been grand!!).I enjoyed reading the journey of a striving artist reaching the pinnacle of her career, and once again striving to maintain her momentum while balancing motherhood, a new-found love life and an ex-husband who's trying to be a friend.

He is having to deal with a lot in this book, but mmmm, there is just something about a tortured hero that is so appealing. This is book 3 of the Compass Brothers series and was about Sam, one of the twins who are the youngest of the brothers. He's only 25, but has already made a big name for himself on Wall Street until his girlfriend betrays him at the company where they both work. Quickly on the heels of that betrayal (like the same day), Sam finds out that his beloved father is dying, so he heads home to the Compton ranch.Home, he finds some things have changed, most specifically the new woman that is handling the ranch's bookkeeping...Cindi. Although Sam has too much on his plate to try to initiate and commit to a relationship, he forms a friendship with Cindi and her allure is intoxicating and so tempting.Overall this is a highly entertaining read and another great installment to this series. I had a few slight issues with the book, but I personally think that they were simply subjective issues for me and would not be problems for others. The twins have always been presented as teens, because they were the youngest. I had a hard time, in this book, moving Sam out of that context and into the adult world in my mind. Also, Cindi has some kinks, as does Sam, that they aren't sharing with each other. I don't have an issue with the kinks, but the way that they came out in the story just seemed a little odd to me. That scene made me uncomfortable and I can't even tell you why because it is something that I usually enjoy in my erotic romance. These were my only problems with this book, and like I said, both of them are VERY subjective.Personally, I like the surprise that came with Cindi's background. I enjoyed getting to spend more time with this family. I love these brothers and the relationship they have with each other. There are some really sad moments happening in this book with their father's health decline, but they are offset wonderfully with humor and love between the boys and their parents.This is a great series about a family that I am REALLY enjoying. I cannot wait to read Sawyer's book. We got a small glimpse of him as he has been off with the Navy and has no idea what is happening at home. A fact that he is NOT going to be happy about.

This is a stand-alone novel.  Kelly Blake has been drummed out of the Galactic Republic's Fighter Force (single person attack craft force) and exiled to Antares Base.  Kelly finds his home with the Galactic Republic's Scout Force which is responsible for monitoring the border with the aggressive K'Rang Empire.  Much of story focuses on intel gathering and covert ops as Scout Force monitors the volatile K'Rang border.  True to the Space Opera tradition, there are major space battles although most of action focuses on smaller skirmishes.For space opera fans, this is a good one and I recommend reading it.  It is well written with no egregious editing issues.  Classic space opera plot line with humans defending against the alien menace.  Light on space battles but not too light.  Heavier on intelligence and scouting which is a refreshing change.  Hero has a girl in every port.  Actually he has three girlfriends in the same port and all three are OK with a non-exclusive arrangement.  This is where story went a little too far for me.  I am OK with the hero gets the pretty girl clicheacute but it is a stretch when every single pretty girl starts chasing him.  But since it is space opera, it is just part of the overall enjoyment of the story.Scout Force is 7,595 Kindle locations long. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range.  Books in Jack Campbell's first Lost Fleet series were approximately 5,000 Kindle locations.","01 22, 2012",A8KRO8GI5CTP1,Mike,Covert Space Opera,1327190400,1.0,True,4.0

555150,B00DFRJK9C,"[1, 2]",3,"I was pleasantly surprised by this debut by Anne Whitney. I wasn't sure what to expect with The Art of Love because I'm a bit underwhelmed with New Adult and where this sub genre or category is heading. The Art of Love is unique though. It features a twenty-one year old Marina who escapes from her abusive father and ends up in Manhattan with no money. She's alone, afraid and hungry. She's given a flier for an art showing, and because it has food, she goes there. What she sees there will shock her silly.The showing is performance art by Fitz, who is nude. Marina and Fitz's first interaction cracked me up because Marina has never seen a penis up close and personal before. Her reaction is priceless:It's hard when you're eye level with a man's naked twig and berries dangling like Christmas ornaments.Fitz realizes Marina is all alone in the world and takes her in like a stray kitten. His gay drag queen brother, Derek (total lubs for this guy) and their other friend, fellow artist Viridian want to help Mariana when they find out why she's on the run and hiding. Fitz, Derek and Viridian become Marina's fairy godmothers in a way and transform her with a makeover that's more of a disguise, as well as to give her confidence. Then Mariana becomes Fitz's personal assistant and that's where things become more interesting.The Art of Love has a fairy tale feeling to it. Marina may at first come across as naive and too innocent but there's more to her than that. Fitz is not your typical love interest found in this type of read. He's really sweet to Marina, and you can't help but fall in love with him. And he has tattoos. Rowl. He has a few secrets, one of which I figured one pretty quickly, but it added something more to the overall story that I felt was needed and to give Fitz more depth to his personality.The writing is pretty good and I loved the character interaction. I adore Derek and want his story next STAT. The way Fitz and Marina act on their attraction is more believable and real with Mariana, who has no experience with men (which again makes sense when you learn her past). There's one scene in a bathroom with Fitz and Marina that may have you fanning yourself.If you're a fan of Painted Faces by L.H. Cosway, I think you'll enjoy The Art of Love. Overall I enjoyed this one. The well rounded, dimensional cast of characters really made this shine and I look forward to more from Anne.Katiebabs","06 17, 2013",A1AKQ1YUS4BT82,Katie Babs Katiebabs,Different Type of New Adult...

She's been perfectly schooled and groomed for nothing else.  However, Elizabeth is a suffragette at heart.  She loves to involve herself in those activities and sports that women of her station are not allowed to indulge in.  She does them anyway.  She isn't selfish or ostentatious.  She genuinely cares about those less fortunate than her and seeks to help the poor something that's just not done!  She wants her independence....she doesn't intend to marry...but IF she marries at all, it will be for love and equality.  She will not accept nothing less and the 55 marriage proposals she's received (and refused) prove that she doesn't intend to settle.But then her childhood nemesis, Robert Bradford, comes back into her life and she finds herself attracted to him.  And since he's been gone for almost fifteen years... she doesn't know him...nor does he recognize her.  Until it's too late.  (dum dum duuuuum)Robert Bradford is the second son of an Earl and one serious dude.  Like Elizabeth, he has no interest in marriage or London's many Balls and parties with all the strutting men looking for wealthy brides.  Nevertheless, to keep his parents happy, he grudgingly consents to attend a few of the events while dodging deliberate compromising traps from women, that could force a proposal.  He has a man-sized temper, very little patience and an unending, raging appetite.  He's bored with the attempted entrapment antics and tiresome ploys of the numerous girls and their mothers to land prestigious and wealthy husbands...preferably one with a title.  None of them can hold an intelligent conversation or thought....until he meets Elizabeth (whom he doesn't recognize as his childhood enemy).

291529,B0093H6FWI,"[0, 0]",5,"Thompson writes characters that a reader wants to know. The good guys are affable and fun. We get them on down time singing karaoke, eating and having beer and eating. Instead of wishing that Thompson would rush the action, those moments are fun with friends. Thompson very cleverly gives everyone a back story, no matter how brief. In one scene we have a grandmother with her grandson at an animal auction. Thompson tells us that her husband died in a flu epidemic but she is ready to move on and has her eye on someone. The hint into her is priceless because as the scene progresses and her grandson is in the path of danger our heart bleeds for her because we know she's suffered enough, don't take her grandson! There's an emotional investment that is invaluable in this sort of story.The plot-line is wonderful. Animals are turning on their owners and killing them. At the start of the novel a young corn detassler (and what young person in Michigan or Ontario wouldn't know all about corn detassling - often a teens first job here) finds a body in the field that has been attacked by emus and subsequently died of a stroke. The young woman puts her hand through his chest and the description is beautifully gory and yet not overly graphic which sounds perhaps a bit contrary. There is a solid and believable scientific base for the story and there are few superhero moments. These are good people doing their best.I do have a bit of a bone to pick with Thompson, the catty female. I hate the female that serves no real purpose but to be catty in a story and Rita is that character with bells on in Chemical Attraction. The character designed to cause a minor stress between the characters. Especially in the case of this novel she came too late to be believed and only serves to counter-act the strong and smart female characters in this novel and shove women back into a weak and petty stereotype. We get it, Joe is hot. That's established. Any female in the novel would sleep with him in a heart-beat. Rita was just unnecessary.Chemical Attraction was a fabulous read. If you like romantic thrillers in the spirit of Sandra Brown you cannot do better than this novel.

921811,B00K5Y8W7Y,"[0, 0]",5,"Last year, I read and enjoyed Compromising Miss Tisdale, the first in the Regency Blooms series, by newcomer Jessica Jefferson. That lovely novel of manners was a charming, funny, and elegant historical romance. And there was one very memorable character who stood out in that debut: Miss Tamsin Tisdale, the heroine8217s sister. Feisty, strong, and tomboyish, this is her happy ending.Marcus Winston, the Duke of Grayson is a true beta hero, very reminiscent of Edward Ailsbury in The Secret Mistress by Mary Balogh. Plagued as a child with 8220the falling disease8221 (epilepsy), he grew up pampered and overprotected by both his parents, but especially his mother. Consequently, he was educated at home instead of attending boarding school, developed a love of books and learning, and learned to dislike the manly pursuits, such as hunting. He8217s a quiet man who prefers to blend in rather than stand out, despite his illustrious title. He is a dutiful son and, even though he knows it will not make him happy, he agrees to entertain the idea of courting the waspish Lady Katherine, whom his mother has her heart set on for his future duchess. In fact, his mother8217s overprotectiveness has begun to feel stifling and, after a youthful rebellion ended in tragedy, he finds it easier to accommodate her. As a result, he has not really enjoyed life all, never traveled, or even had a pet.Until Tamsin Tisdale bursts into his sedate (read: boring) life. After meeting her, for the first time in his sheltered life, Marcus wants to throw caution to the wind. After listening to her (rumored) impressions of the reclusive and mysterious Duke that show him in an unattractive light, he introduces himself merely as Mr. Winston, cousin to the duke, to get to know her better. This little ruse allows him to be someone else besides a proper and stuffy duke.Tamsin Tisdale is the spirited daughter of a viscount and is anything but proper. She accidentally stumbles onto the duke8217s estate, Beardsley, during an invigorating morning ride and captivates Marcus (who is out for a walk) with her freshness, vivacity, and directness. He is completely entranced and besotted. She speaks her mind8212as she did most boldly in Compromising Miss Tisdale8212and is in the country visiting her cousin Elizabeth8217s family after being banished to the north for a petty ton scandal. In his animated descriptions to Jason St. Regis, his best friend, Marcus likens her appearance to a fairy or a sprite with her glorious red hair, freckles, and impish manner. It8217s completely unaffected, unlike most of the posturing ladies he meets. He has never met anyone like her.8220Miss Tisdale clearly had no idea her power over men. Her unique blend of naivety and lack of inhibition made her an irresistible combination. There was no way she8217d make it through another Season unbetrothed8212no man was foolish enough to let someone like her slip through their fingers, or their bed.8221 (p119)Tamsin has no patience for propriety, fashionable dress, or the insincerity of Polite Society. She doesn8217t think, she reacts, and this gets her into all kinds of humorous scrapes and incidences. But each proves to only make her even more tempting and attractive to Marcus and make the quiet life he has led thus far seem very mundane indeed. I love her unaffectedness in fact, in one scene, we find her languorously lounging on a chaise, daydreaming, her fingers skimming the floor. In another, Jason mistakes her for a servant!8220She found the opposite sex to be friendly enough, but couldn8217t really envision any man meaning more to her than that8230She chose to live her life solely for herself, depending on no one. Marriage meant the complete opposite of the ideals she held so strongly.8221 (p37)When Tamsin discovers she has fallen hard for Marcus, it upsets and unnerves her. Her revelation recalls Emma Woodhouse8217s own startling realization of her singular love for Mr. Knightley in Emma by Jane Austen.8220She8217d always prided herself on her self-reliance, yet whenever he was around it was as if she was always in need of his assistance in one way or another. While in his presence, even the basic task of walking had become a challenge necessitating his heroic intervention. And she didn8217t care for that one bit.8221 (p105)8220It was unfathomable how something like this could have happened8212and to her of all people. After all the safeguards she8217d put into place, she8217d believed herself invincible. Her ugly gowns comparable to that of chainmail, her cunning words her shield. And yet he8217d penetrated through all of that. It was disheartening, but she8217d but  fool to argue with the truth. Shea was in love with Mr. Winston.8221 (p135)Marcus and Tamsin8217s love story has a joyous quality to it, of young love, of two unlikely hearts finding each other, and of the humor and fun to be had spending time together. Whenever Marcus encounters Tamsin, it is spiced with almost slapstick adventure as well as vivid sexual tension. The best part of their love story is how it takes both of them by complete surprise.8220A small element of danger, a dash of daring, and certainly a feeling of freedom he8217d seldom felt before. This was what life with Tamsin Tisdale would be about.8221 (p208)His best friend Jason is the complete opposite of Marcus he8217s a suave playboy and a hopeless seducer. In fact, he sports a mild flirtation with Tamsin, but she thinks of him only as a friend, much to Marcus8217 angry and frustrated relief.There are some wonderfully humorous moments in this romance, such as Marcus8217 midnight visit, the bantering between Marcus and Regis, and the way Elizabeth (Tamsin8217s ladylike cousin) despairs of her cousin8217s behavior. The writing style is elegant and sparkling and the minor characters Jason St. Regis8212whose own happy ending is hinted at8212Marcus8217 overbearing mother, and Elizabeth are all well-drawn and characterized. We also discover Tamsin8217s unique and different floral name, hence the name of the series.If I have one quibble, it8217s a minor one. I do not like the cover. The hero looks too old for the heroine and it8217s nothing at all like I picture Marcus.A most pleasing and amusing love story in a series that I look forward to reading more of.Note: a modified version of this review first appeared on the Romantic Historical Reviews blog.","07 15, 2014",A331IHH6S1V861,M.

625644,B00EQ88XJC,"[0, 0]",4,"This was a refreshing time travel story because it didn8217t take itself too seriously with paradoxes and worries about exact science or ripple effects in time. What was relevant was the romance between Andreacute and Maya 8211 how they met, what they did and how their love grew. It8217s a story of two people whose only difference, besides being man and woman, was being born in a different time and country.I have to smile because all the tricky explanations of how many things are able to happen in the first place can be summed up in one word 8211 magic. The author had fun wrapping the fabric of time around her finger and created a very interesting world of possibility. It8217s said that with all things, love makes the impossible, possible. Ms. Leon certainly explored the sticky wicket of what happens if someone says or does the wrong thing back in time and affects the current time. I liked what she came up with. It was inventive, unique and although some critics would say it was a trifle too pat, I say, it8217s magic, and magic defies logic. So just sit back and enjoy a good tale. The author delivers some solid entertainment in Fairy in the Flesh.I enjoyed how Andreacute8217s character was depicted. He8217s passionate, emotional, but not in a wimpy whiny kind of way, and a lustsome man with strong urges. Yet, he8217s reverent too and all of that handsome yumminess is focused on Maya. The author wrote some delightfully sexy scenes with a few naughty shenanigans thrown in for extra spice, like a brief moment of voyeurism. There is a BDSM flavor to a couple of the scenes but nothing that falls into the standard definition of that kind of relationship. I liked how carried away they sometimes got as well as how each encounter sparked a creative genius in the hero and a strengthening love in Maya. In essence, they were seducing each other.The ending is a sweet happy ever after. The difference Maya8217s love had on Andreacute is never more clear or as profound as what is revealed at the end. At one point I was aghast that she was arrested. But never fear. Ms. Leon knew exactly what she was doing and I was wowed by that clever twist. I think it was that part that made this story so much better. I was surprised and emotionally shocked because by then I was invested in caring for the heroine. How could the author DO that to her? The answer was astounding.Fairy in the Flesh is a good story. It has its surprises but it8217s the chemistry and fireworks between Andreacute and Maya that drew me in and kept me. I loved the descriptions of the magic at work and although it conveniently removed any complications from the lack of logic, I was fine with that. It allowed me to concentrate on the good stuff 8211 the hero and heroine and their fiery, wild and oh-so-satisfying sex life and the proof of the power of love.

He thought he had plenty of time to make her his but he wasn't quite ready to make things permanent. She certainly would have accepted his proposal, if he had made one.Two months later she was married to the one man who had offered for her. Her family thrilled that she had provided for them.Would have been really hard to live in those times, where your wishes and hopes didn't matter...only the bottom line did.Nine years later Caroline is widowed, and a year later, after her year of mourning, she's ready to LIVE. She refuses to be tied down again. She has her widows' pension and she refuses to be beholden to any man.But maybe she can find just a jot of happiness? A bit of passion? Some time to be merry? A fling without any strings?Unfortunately Sutbridge wants it all. He wants to marry and have heirs and be with his love, the woman who he has waited all this time for.There's stubbornness and hurt feelings on both sides of this coin. But there's also an undeniable attraction. Made for some fun reading.For a short story, this one had a pretty complete story line. I was impressed with how much Ms. Darby fit into about 40 pages.

I'm always left wanting more.So, when I got my hands on Tragically Flawed, I had to start reading right away.What I discovered was a captivating love story with flesh and blood characters haunted by their past.Riviera has escaped an abusive relationship, but the scars and bruises remain on the inside long after they fade from her body.Starting over in a new town, she finds a roommate who becomes her close friend and supporter.While her talent for painting lands Riviera a job quickly, her boss is insecure and has a reputation for bullying her employees.Shan is the owner of Shandon Homes and that's how they first meet. While working in what Riviera thinks is an empty house, her boisterous singing awakens a monster. Shan storms in, shouting abuse and reduces her to a quivering wreck.Their first meeting may have been a disaster but as they work together and begin to know each other, their attraction grows.Can two damaged people, one unable to forgive himself for a past tragedy and one running from the echoes of her previous life find healing and trust through each other?Riviera is a woman to applaud. Scared and vulnerable, she's also strong and determined. Sure, she's danced with the devil, but she still believes there's good in the world.Shan is sexy, bold and alpha all the way, but he's burdened with guilt over his part in the loss of a friend. Riviera slips past the walls he hides behind and gives him hope.There are some secondary characters you'll meet and want to know more about and a boss from the dark side that you'll love to hate.Tragically Flawed was a fast read for me. It dabbled in the dark side but it was also funny and sexy.About the sexy. If you blush easily you're going to have rosy cheeks. A.M. Hargrove is really good at raising your blood pressure and steaming up your kindle.This book was beyond what I hoped it would be and I'll be recommending it to all who'll listen. Except for the young readers. The content is for a mature reader.I'm tickled pink to give it a resounding 5 STARSI received this book for my honest review.

They are both determined, driven, and want things to run their way. Problem is, neither of them will back down. The story was very interesting to me because it isn't a common plot that I have run across, so I was engrossed in the story from the beginning. When you throw in two strong personalities, a few bad guys and a lot of great dialogue between the main characters,  you have an entertaining story that is hard to put down.Gabe is referred to by Jo as Mr. August - the hottest month on the calendar. She and him have such intense chemistry but neither wants to act on because it could put an end to their spot on the task force. They try to ignore it but eventually give in. After they realize how good they can be together they try to maintain business as usual when they are on the job. Easier said than done. In one scene, when Gabe has to save Jo's life he lets his emotions get the best of him by going after one of the people he felt was responsible.Jo is a tough attorney and this task force means everything to her. The mayor of New York is trusting her with this and she hopes if she does well in New York, it will go national. She takes it very seriously and the excitement of tracking down a smuggler often leads to lack of good judgment on her part and she finds herself in situations in which Gabe has to step in and save her. Neither of them like that - Jo because she wants to take care of herself and Gabe because he doesn't want her interfering in police work or worse, hurt.Adrienne does a really good job of setting up this series. I look forward to reading more about Gabe and Jo and watching them navigate this relationship of theirs while they try to bring down the one of the biggest smuggling operations of counterfeit merchandise in New York.

I picked this up on the netgalley review site and enjoyed it so much that I went on to read the two books that preceded this one about the other two brothers.Sean returns to town at the request of his brothers to help out with some negotiations they have with a builder. The builder himself turns out to be a surprise, but I'll leave that to you to find out. I am hoping, though, that there's also a book about him coming out soon.Abby and Sean have a past they were friends growing up, helping each other out because both their families treated them badly. But after one time being intimate together, Sean leaves town, his family, and Abby, and he joins up with a motorcycle club, ultimately serving as their enforcer.Once Abby and Sean reconnect, the sex is hot, and both give each other what they need. And Sean is the epitome of a bad boy.He'd always had a smoldering bad-boy look to him, even back when he'd been eighteen, but with the short sleeves of his T-shirt revealing tattooed biceps, and that slashing scar and broken nose, at twenty-three, he was the every definition of a sexy, dangerous, bad man.I wouldn't call this an erotic book, per se, because the storyline is so strong, but the main characters do connect in a satisfactorily way with lots of heat....he preferred his sex hard and rough. There was something satisfying in the violence of it, in the same way that beating the s*** out of someone was satisfying. An outlet for anger and frustration. And he always chose women who liked it like that, women who could handle it. Who wanted it.Although the book was short, Ashenden definitely tells a fully developed story that fully resolves itself by the end. And both characters help each other stop running from their pasts, their futures, and each other.","04 17, 2014",A3B1AC4I9RS1MJ,alligatorsmith,Sean and Abby - a great end to the hot books about the Morrow brothers,1397692800,0.0,False,4.0

I had never heard of this author or read any of her work until now, and since I usually tend to read the more darker, grittier stuff, TRUST looked like it would be right up my alley. I really wanted to love it and for the most part, it was a well written suspenseful book with no glaring typos or hard to understand plot, but I think my issue is that there are just way too many books on the market right now with almost the exact same story, so it lacked the originality that would have given it that edge.Gwen is the well known, well liked cheerleader in her small town and when she is kidnapped on her way home late at night, her whole world is forever changed.Lance is the son of The Boss, the despicable head of a corporation that has many business ventures, one of which is the sale of women as sexual slaves to wealthy clients. When he is assigned to the beautiful, virginal Gwen as her trainer the inevitable happens...and of course he falls for her and his business now becomes more pleasure than training with her.There is a lot more background story and plots behind the scene, regarding Lance and his father and the true nature of their relationship, as well as some revelations about Lance's real motives for helping Gwen. I can't really say too much without spoiling the surprises and twists.TRUST is suspenseful, violent and disturbing at times as well as filled with plenty of sexual encounters (both con and non-con) between Gwen and her captors. It was a fast paced dark romance and my main regret is that there was nothing new or original to differentiate it from all of the other capture books I have already read...I kept thinking everything sounded too familiar.It can be read as a standalone since there is a sort of HEA at the end...but there is room left for a continuation if the author decides to wrap up a couple of loose ends that could become more of a story down the road.**** 4 **** trust is a two-way street stars","06 25, 2014",A3W3XC01BFJJMR,Sue B.,A suspenseful and at times disturbing book...with a few twists,1403654400,0.9090909090909091,True,4.0

Running beneath it all is a dialogue about how we consume, in this book literally, our popular culture.Geekomancy is an urban fantasy series featuring geekomancers in which the hook is that items of pop culture, (books, games, cards, figurines, movie clips), are actual sources of magical power, and allow possessors to use weapons and skills that are based on those cultural artifacts. (So, our heroine uses a lightsaber, while someone else has a nail gun from a first person shooter). The running discussion addresses the fact that these artifacts must be consumed, and thus lost, to power up items.This book covers a side quest by Ree Reyes, heroine ofGeekomancy (Ree Reyes). She and some of the regulars at Grognard's are trapped in the bar by villainous beasts and have to fight and think their way out. The book is a bit longer than a novella, but short for a full novel, so it it offers a very nice entry to the Geekomancy world. You don't need to be familiar with the other books in the series you'll pick up enough to follow the action and characters within the first chapter or two.The book has a rat-a-tat feel. Some geekiness, a battle, smart-ass dialogue, another battle, an argument about what steampunk really is, a reminiscence about some pop icon, another battle, Ree thinking about her life, a conflict with another geek, a berserker rampage, then a quiet moment with magical med kits and health potions. It's rich - loaded with every kind of geek and tabletop reference imaginable - but that's all icing and the central action is always easy to follow no matter how obscure or elaborate the references are.Everything in the book is a sideways commentary on some aspect of geekiness. The relative power of different artifacts tells you what the author thinks about the merits of their sources. Each character is a version of some aspect of geekiness. Each argument between characters is a little highbrow, or lowbrow, cultural debate. Everybody in the book is a fanboy, or loves fanboys, or hates fanboys, or embraces the idea of fanboys, or rejects fanboydom, so that the whole effort sometimes reads like a poorly moderated flame war on someone's blog. But then the trolls attack again and all is forgiven.Bottom line - if you like or are interested in or are curious about any of this stuff, you really need to try a Geekomancy book. (Try to get a first edition first editions and mint editions of things have more power.)Please note that I received a free advance ecopy of this book in exchange for a candid review.

She is afraid she is unsuited to step into his shoes so soon, but when the Gripthia hits her fellow Aemet, she must step up to heal them as good as she can.  She is a Mage who can use healing stones to keep the sick alive long enough for their bodies to heal themselves. She remains in the city with the sick Aemets and all the well ones go on a mass exodus to avoid catching the demon Gripthia.The flying dragonish Korvi, and the fox-like Ferrin are the most interdependent.  Korvi fly to trade and act as messengers, they are also strong enough to mine for the gemstones which hold mage power.  Long-lived Peregrine has mined for many decades and has lost his hearing.  Over these years he has had Ferrin to aide in hearing and his latest is Tillian, who he has raised from babyhood.  The Ferrin also perform tasks suited to their size and high energy.  Peregrine and Tillian are paired for her lifetime.During the crisis Peregrine, who has just ended his mining career has just attempted his first messenger flight with Tillian.  They go to Roses town and find Rose overworked and short handed.  He leaves Tillian with Rose who welcomes her capable paws.The Aemet are farmers and also labor in the cities, so the Gripthia hits the races equally hard because of the specialization and interdependency of the species.  The Ferrin usually attach themselves to a family and their litters pledge to work and live for successive lifetimes.  Peregrine has seen 6 generations of Ferrin, or clan children,  in his almost 150 year life, 100 of which were spent being a miner.  His wife is Gralia, a potter, who joins Peregrine as a messenger in these trying times of need.The structure of this world and it citizens is well thought out.

This second installment in her Thompson  Sons series is a sweet yet sexy romance between Len Thompson and his younger sister8217s good friend Janey Watson.Janey and Len are well-drawn and realistic protagonists who are complete opposites. Janey has a vivacious, outgoing personality and she enthusiastically embraces life. Len is quiet, reserved and he sits back and observes everyone around him.  Janey is an open book while Len is the epitome of the strong, silent type.Janey and Len have been a part of one another8217s lives for a long time and this longstanding history provides a realistic backdrop for their transition from friends to lovers. They remain pretty true to their personalities with Janey jumping wholeheartedly into their relationship while Len wants to take things a little slower. Their romance begins with sweetly innocent dates that heat up pretty quickly and Len8217s reluctance to take their relationship to the a more intimate level results in the first of his unexpected revelations.Their mostly laidback and easygoing relationship hits a major snag when Len8217s unresolved past comes between them. But Janey is not completely blameless in the situation since she has not been completely honest with Len about a decision she has made concerning her future. This conflict provides a major turning point for Len but Janey8217s lack of communication is never addressed and he (unfairly) shoulders the burden for repairing the rift between them.With One Sexy Ride, Vivian Arend brings readers another enchanting love story that is full of vibrant and engaging characters. The story is well-written and quite heartwarming and the sex scenes are scorching hot. A wonderful addition to the Thompson  Sons series that old and new fans are sure to love!I received a complimentary copy for review.","07 7, 2014",A3RHTYOGSITLWN,K.

These modified men with grey eyes are working hard and fast to find the code that will stop the kill switch implanted in their spine. In the first book we have Shane Dean who married Josie to try and get information on the nameless project run by the ruthless Commander and his bitch lover Dr. Madison. They didn8217t find what they needed but they did find out that the youngest brother Jory who they believed to be dead might be alive. Next we have (my favorite) Matt Dean who is undercover looking for a doctor who worked on the project and just might be the key to the kill switch code. What he didn8217t count on was falling in love with the Doctor. Elaine 8220Laine8221 didn8217t know what she got herself in too but is more than willing to help save them. No new information was learned about Jory or the kill switches but they did learn Nate might be a father.  And now we have Nate.This series is action packed it makes you want to fit bump the air and smack characters in the back of their head Gibbs style for being idiots. The second chance romance, still one of my favorites, leads to some pretty hot sex8230 and a baby. Nate who came across like an ass in the previous books is shone in a different light as well as heartbreaker Audrey. Audrey who we learned previously broke Nate8217s heart because as the daughter of Dr. 8220Bitch8221 Madison was just being used as an experiment to see what would happen between them.The book opens up with Nate in disguise at a political function Audrey has attended. Reunited again Nate almost at once forgives Audrey when he learns she lost the baby to a miscarriage and was seriously injured in the explosion of the compound when they had escaped five years before. Audrey had several surgeries to repair the damage done and still has to watch how she walks so she doesn8217t show a limp. Nate still believing she is working with the Commander tries to talk her out of what ever it is she is doing but what he doesn8217t know is that Audrey is playing a double agent. Audrey is spying on the Commander for the Senator she works for.Things go astray when Audrey witness a murder of a acquaintance who knows all about the project and the Commander and is willing to help shut it down, and know Audrey is targeted to be killed. Yes there is a baby coming into play but I will leave how a surprise. Now the Dean brothers work together to save Audrey and her unborn baby, try to destroy the Commander and this new group set to destroy everything, find the code to the kill switch and find out what happened to Jory.So much happens in this book and it still leaves off (NO CLIFFHANGER) with one more book to go.

First things first I LOVED this book!! The world building was outrageously good and the premise was SoOOOOOO original! It was like Brave New world meets 1984 meets The Handmaid8217s Tale, Mirror X had little glimpses of each and it was woven together perfectly creating a completely brand new world on the cusp of destruction! One thing I have to point out is the synopsis on goodreads is wrong... it states Cassie comes from a space capsule. In the book that is not true. This is going to be a series so it may turn out that she was in a space capsule, but in the book she was discovered in a warehouse in a cryogenic chamber. The reason I said yet is because this book is LOADED with twists and turns ups and downs so even though we are told that from the very beginning it very may well turn out to be something different. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK in this series!!M-ystery, Cassie wakes in a curious state unaware of the deception that surrounds her.I-nnocent, young and alone in a strange world Cassie doesn8217t want to trust but she has no choice.R-evelations, things have been set in motion Cassie cannot run but the most painful thing is those she has come to care about are the ones keeping secrets.R-egret, Dr Bennett promised to take care of Cassie but his feelings have developed into much more. The lies and deception haunt his every thought.O-ptions, no longer having any left Cassie will venture on a very dangerous path but she will do whatever it takes to protect whats important.R-eprieve, for a small moment Cassie embraces the warmth that radiates through her heart. Within this tiny window she has everything she could wish for.X-tinction, (I8217m totally cheating with this one lol! *winky) Cassie knows what must be done her heart and love for humanity will be her guiding point. Turning her back would only result in death. Faced with a scary future she will strive to be everything she can be to help create a better world.OMGee!!! So many things I want to talk about!! Okay here is one8230 You have to be a pretty mature reader for this one. What I mean by that is, its pretty controversial so as a reader you have to have that mature mentality to be able to look at the issues from different angles. Genetics is always a touchy subject if you can remove your opinion on the matter and try to understand everyones different perspective then the enjoyment of this novel becomes ten fold! There are so many mysteries that I didn8217t even know were mysteries until I got punched in the face with a bazinga. The punches kept rolling all the way until the very end with the exception of a couple things that seemed pretty obvious EVERYTHING else was surprising and shocking. I loved loved loved this first installment which is going to give 2 pretty harsh and maybe unattainable high expectations, I hope Ms Thompson is up for the challenge. As it stands Mirror X was pretty flippin stellar!!My Fav8217sMagnumWait till you meet him!! He totally Rocked my socks and the way he was there for Cassie was incredible!! I think he's keeping a secret...shhhhMichaelWe find out some pretty shocking things about him ESPECIALLY towards the end and it broke my heart. He hasn8217t been the best decision maker but when he starts leading with his heart is when I started falling for him. Not sure how much, yet.TravelWow, he was heartbreakingly amazing. I wanted so so so much! I love this guy 100% I fell for him straight away the way he cared for Cassie was amazing!CassieAt first I wanted to punch her because I thought she was being selfish BUT when I opened my mind and started looking at things from different perspectives I understood.

She tells him no, I won't be bought and he comes up with another way to take charge of her.....he said you don't want to be bought? What do you have that I can buy from you?

Let me say that I am extremely happy I did, because The Hart Family books are pretty out of this world good.Broken Hart follows the story of Sabrina and Dante as they go from having a strong working relationship, as well as a pretty deep friendship, to rocking the boat by taking that relationship to a new level. What ensues when these two finally come together is hot with a capital H, and will leave you rooting for this couple. Dante is fierce and is a force to be reckoned with.

Sabrina was an wonderful female character to read. She is unapologetic when it comes to Dante, and I loved reading through her eyes. Her relationships with others were fantastic to read. She also has her crap together (except maybe when it comes to being with the one she wants to be with) which was really nice to read.I loved reading Broken Hart.

Ok, so let's be methodical.This is book 2 in a series called Gray Zone, and I haven't read book 1 (ofc, I seem to do this a lot...), but I didn't really feel like I was denied any relevant info because of that. I really appreciated the glossary of terms and short presentation of the world at the beginning of the novel, to me that made this read as much a stand alone as it is a part of a series of course, it's that type of series that tells us about different characters within the same world or universe or whatever you'd like to call it. And what a wonderfully imaginative world!I'm a great fan of dragons myself, so these beautiful creatures the author has created, this whole social order (or lack thereof in some areas) is totally fascinating to me.Liam, Chris and Kevin took my heart by storm, I ached for them. One thing that's clear though is this is a very mature read, and not just because there's some one on one action going on, but because of the brutal life these characters lead, because of the nature of the world they inhabit. And Liam gets to sample all the brutality of it, all the ugliness of it and yet he keeps a beautifully loving heart, he's a mother hen for his younger brothers and he's willing to bear whatever in order to keep them safe, in order to protect them and offer them as much of a good life as he can manage.It was almost emotionally draining to witness Liam's life, I couldn't read this book all in one go, I felt the need to take breathers now and then, it just got to feel like too much at times. At the same time, fiction as it may be, I kept thinking about these cases I've learned of, real-life stories that resembled so much his story that it sent me reeling. I find it interesting that when met in fiction-clad form, the brutality of the human being is shocking, and yet we learn of all these real cases and we just cruise by them on a day to day basis. Funny how ours minds work, huh? Anyways, back to the book.The characters were, in my opinion, amazing, and here's why: there was nothing like posing about them, they didn't feel built or put together as it sometimes happens with characters going through dramatic situations, they felt so incredibly real and natural, truly vivid. Their reactions, their feelings, everything - absolutely natural, real. Of course that seems to work for and against the reading experience, in the fact that it always seems easier to go through dramatic happenings with a character that feels a bit made up, you know? It's like an intense but not uncomfortable exercise of the imagination, whereas a really good character doesn't feel like a character at all but like one of your friends, so going through really bad stuff with them isn't quite as easy.The plot was interesting and eventful without becoming actually overwhelming until nearer the end, where there was this really intense scene that made me hold my breath, I was like Oh nooooooo!!!, but thankfully for my heart it got resolved in a reasonably short time :DIf you'll approach this as a smutty read, you'll be very surprised and I mean very. I will confess it turned out to have substantially more punch to it then I expected as well, and I was extremely pleased with that. Of course, it's a predictable reaction on my part, all my favorite reads revolve around really dramatic situations and stories.So to sum it all up, if you're not iffy about dramatic stories with violent content, I say give this a try, it's somewhat brutal but beautiful as well, because it's about human nature, true human nature in all it's raw glory.","01 18, 2012",A3E90N4K71BXU4,L.E.Olteano - Butterfly-o-meter Books,True human nature in all it's raw glory.,1326844800,1.0,True,4.0

She starts to think more about the people around her and what they are all risking too. She had been so caught up in her little bubble, that it was refreshing to see her realize there is so much more going on than just her issues.Oh the boys!! Okay, so I am going to be vague here, but there was a love triangle in the first book. If you've read it you already know that, but if you haven't, rest assured that it's not a love triangle just for the sake of having one. It does make sense and I loved where it went in this. Yes, she does choose between them and I think that she did well at making the decision that was best for her. I love how protective both of them are for her, and she does care about them both, but she can only be with one.So, I know that this is a really short review, but I want to keep this spoiler free. Just know that this was amazing and it really continued the story well. There was a lot of tension, and things get pretty tough. There are a few twists and trust is tested as well as relationships between Brooke and the others. I have a lot of love for this series and I thought this sequel was really great! I love it when I love a second book better than the first and this sure did that. I will read anything that Angeline Kace writes. She is fantastic at sucking into the story and holding you there.*An advanced copy of the book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.

Jack's unique knowledge as a historian proves to be a lifesaving thing as he uses the lessons learned in the distant past to help his family survive in the drastically changed world. The novel is written in the first person narrative which really pulls you into the thoughts and actions of Jack as he deals with the tumultuous reality his life has now become.This has a clean, sharp tone that really lends to the dystopian genre in a great way it's evocative, gripping, engaging and immensely entertaining.

Apart from a one night stand when they first met Blake has always kept Kim at a distance but her attraction to him has continued to grow and she is determined to take things a step further this year. Blake has wanted Kim from the moment they met but a nasty divorce has left him wary of relationships, Kim is special though and he finally feels ready to take a risk.I was already a fan of Christine d'Abo so I had high hopes for Naughty Nicks and I wasn't disappointed, it had everything I look for in a Christmas story - great characters, a cute romance and sexy stripping Santas! Kim and Blake have brilliant chemistry but Blake has several reasons to be wary of pursuing a romance with her, he worries about their age difference and the fact that he's her boss but the biggest block of all is the number his ex-wife did on him when she left him. He has so much fun with Kim but is scared of losing her as a friend if they try and fail at a relationship. It was so easy to tell how perfect these two were for each other and I really enjoyed Kim's attempts at seducing Blake.

She talked about having sex with everything that moved.  Even going so far as to try and lose 25 lbs. before her high school crush, she did him at prom, comes back to town for the 10 year reunion.  They have not kept in touch, etc., he just calls to say he is coming and to get ready.  So she is going to wild extremes to get in shape for his return.  He sounds like a pig to me.She meets Dante, a very Italian male.  I think she wants to avoid an involvement because he represents the male Italian's point of view, keep the woman in the kitchen while he is out with the boys.  It seems that way.  I don't really know Italian culture at all.  But he doesn't seem to want a relationship either, he just wants to have sex with her.  Now, she has sex with a guy she met at a cousin's wedding, the same night she met him, a loser with a capital L, but she is trying to avoid this guy.  I'm not sure I get her reasoning.  Seems like he would be the perfect candidate to end her dry spell.  He is HOT, he wants her but doesn't want a relationship.  Her perfect man yet she is putting him off.  WHY?It seems her family as well as all the other characters have only one thing on their mind, marry and have children.  Something she definitely does not want to do.  Not sure why.  There is nothing wrong with the story, I just could not get into it.  I liked Dante, a chef, but it seemed like his only interest in Maria was her big boobs and lush body.

What about a horrible and ignominious death for Admiral Larry Tucker? With all of the people he's tried to ruin over the years attempting to save him but too late. I know FBI's Peggy Ryan got a heroic death but Tucker's an even worse person than she was. He'd never intentionally put himself in harms way.

You will not find any spoilers in my reviews because it takes away from the reader's enjoyment.  I might throw a few teasers.  This is book 2 of her new Maverick Montana series the first being Against the Wall.  If you've not read Against the Wall then you need to STOP right now and go get it fast.  You'll have until May 27th to complete, but I guarantee you will be done in a day or two tops.  And unlike me you will be able to purchase Under The Covers immediately.Under the Covers is Quinn Lodge and Juliet (Spazzoli) Montgomery's story and a story it is.  You have Quinn Lodge Alpha Male personified, ex-military, cowboy, Sheriff with PTSD, causing his violent nightmares. Very dominate, always has to be in control and just plain sexy.  Then comes Juliet (Spazzoli) Montgomery.  She makes me chuckle.  Brought up to always be a lady in her speech and mannerism's she's the one person that can really tear down Quinn's walls.  She too has a past she's trying to keep secret and start a new life. But she fears her past is starting to catch up with her. Thus the reason for (Spazzoli) you need to read and find out where this comes from.It is election time and Quinn Lodge needs to re-run for his position as Sheriff, and this time around he will have competition.  Here is where the story begins.  Just to lay some ground work for you the Mayor has been pushing his niece Amy on Quinn, which isn't going to happen. It is in the opening chapter that Quinn finds out from Juliet that she can no longer keep the gallery because she's run out of funds and is planning on leaving.  Since he's her landlord he strikes a deal with her.  She has to pretend to be his date for a fundraiser and his girlfriend for at least six months and can stay rent free.  Very very clever man.  At the fundraiser the banter that goes on between Amy and Juliet is comical since Amy has no clue she's being cut down/made fun of.The heat and emotions between Quinn and Juliet are definitely felt throughout their story.  Finally Juliet succumbs to the desire to be in Quinn's arms (telling herself she'll be leaving soon so why not take what she wants and have her moment of happiness) knowing she'll hurt him when she leaves and also knowing she can't give up her secret past.  Just a side comment, my fav character Bob from Against the Wall pops in and out a few times in Juliet's dreams telling her to give up her secret and tell Quinn.When Quinn one evening tells Juliet why he never has anyone stay over the night, Juliet then realizes he trusted her to give up his secret and she decides she's going to tell Quinn of her past.  But there never seems to be a right time.Her past does come back to haunt her, things start to unravel and fast and she tells Quinn about her past but not in the most ideal situation.  Do not fear the entire town likes her and are busy bodies with the leader being Loni (Quinn's Mom).  From Mrs. Hudson bringing them to her home under false pretenses (separate phone calls) to the town bakery sending over cookies with QJ on them.  This was so cute and put a smile on my face.  I can't give up detail I just can't you need to read this book.I will say the end of the book brought a hitch to my breath and happy tears.Rebecca you so did it again.  I give Under the Covers 5* and I can't wait to see who's story is next.  Will it be Colton, or will it be Hawk and Dawn.  The heat between these two needs to be explored.

No one starts a religion or eats anybody and in reality the 'strange land' goes to the 'stranger' (Austin) but it felt like a 21st century reboot for the classic story.Chris Nuttall has done some interesting works with his Empire's Corps.  The series goes from good military sci-fi following Marines stranded on the fringe of a dying Empire to stand alone books in the same universe that are really compelling and fun to read.  'When the Bough Breaks', ' The Outcast' and now 'Reality Check' all use interesting characters to fill-in the universe and showcase differences between statist and voluntarist societies.  'Reality Check' is the most brutally honest of the stories so far.  Does Nuttall carry things to a ridiculous extreme or just follow the road we are on to its ultimate destination?  Time will only tell but I hope we never have to find out.  Chris Nuttall takes the idealized oxymoron of Social Justice to its ultimate result.Is it really five stars?

Bartaz-Logstead is indeed, as the title suggests, quite disrespectful, but always in a loving way that encourages a thoughtful/witty response and not in a way that makes the author defensive. I could never ask some the questions she does but the book did encourage me to take a more laid back approach and think outside the box. Basically, we could all stand to lighten up and not take ourselves too seriously. Sometimes a *disrespectful* question provides more insight to an authors personality.A few interviews felt like an inside joke between friends that I wasn't getting but the majority have a fun, conversational flow, while others read like you're attending a celebrity roast. The bet ones were when the author was in on the joke and gave back as good as they got.The Disrespectful interviewer is a collection of 13 interviews, originally seen in the Writer-in-Residence column for BiblioBufffet e-zine, between 2009-2010 but read as a book, several of the questions were repeated often enough that I had to take a break from reading.

This book was definitely no different in that fact however, it was very much different from all of her other novels...just as each one is. I absolutely loved this book and actually took my time reading it so that I could process each and every detail. Which is something that I do not normally do. The storyline, characters, setting, every detail was like a fine piece of chocolate that you let melt in your mouth to savor the moment. There were so many different aspects that I can appreciate about this novel...too many to list in fact. So I will just state enough to get a reader interested and hooked...*giggles*In the beginning of the book I was a bit hesitant due to just how different the lives of the main characters, Hutch and A'ris, were that I wondered how their lives could possibly intertwine. That was soon revealed as I read on and because totally engrossed with finding out just what was going to happen next with the rebelling princess and roaming pauper. The plot thickens when they meet and find out their destinies are truly entwined and reluctantly join forces to complete the princesses mission...rebel against her father, the king. Throughout this love/hate relationship they develop turns into so much more, proving that opposites truly do attract. So many twists and turns go on throughout this adventurous and heart wrenching story that will leave you falling off of the edge of your seat once the cliffhanger of an ending finally does hit. Which, for the record, I am completely unhappy with due to the fact that I now have to wait too long to find out what happens next. Tomorrow wouldn't even be soon enough.I will close with this..The Dry Lands is truly a work of fictional art and is definitely going in my favorites collection.

Her character was well developed and fit the role perfectly.  This is written in first person.  Other characters were brought into the storyline well, but we were not given a lot of insight into their personas.I love the way the book flows.  It never has a hiccup causing it to be very difficult to put down!  This is a mystery but not a heavyweight with difficult subplots and gruesome details.  It allowed me the joy of a mystery.  I would like to have seen more romance . But that is just a personal preference.I found Mercy's relationship with her mom and dad to be just a bit too over the top.  What parents of an adult child who has a career would demand them to handle every detail they give her?  And what adult would be able.to.accomish all those tasks and keep their own lives afloat? !  The willingness on Mercy's part to assist when ask is endearing and emphasizes a strong family bond - just may need to be tempered some.  That said, I did so enjoy the family detective team concept especially since mom and daughter are not detectives. Makes it intriguing.

I believe it was the Catholic Church that used to require counseling before marrying. I'm not sure they still do, but I'm talking more than just counseling. With Divorce as easy as a whim these days, relationships and marriage have no meaning and our society is suffering because if it. This, along with book 1, is vital to that end. I rated this 4 stars because it gets kind of long into the philosophy of relationships. Great stuff, well thought out, just kinda long-winded for my tastes.

We are distinct bioelectric entities and possess paranormal powers whether we believe or not.  The earth is surrounded by auras we may or may not see.8220For those who believe, no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe, no explanation will suffice.8221 Joseph DunnigerIf you take the time to read carefully you will learn how to quickly overcome the obstacles, fear, and trepidation that fills your everyday life.  You may decide to tap into your innate ability to read thoughts, discover unknown forces, locate hidden treasure, win at your favorite game, or possibly help people.Our physical and psychic senses can become honed to blend together, allowing the mind over matter principle to really become inherent to our existence.  Most of us live in our comfort zone, rather than thinking outside the box.  If you learn to break free of your lack of confidence and insecurities you can achieve great feats.  I can personally attest to the power of Ki Force, intuition and empathy in my life.I highly recommend thinking twice before leaping off your next cliff, conversing with strangers, or confronting the unknown.  Instead, learn to grab a beam of energy from the earth, dispel all your anger into a rock and safely throw it away, create your own personal wall of ASP, use a magical quartz crystal, embed yourself in a golden light of energy protection, dream travel, or tap into your special Ki Force.  If you practice your psychic defenses, flex your paranormal muscles against negative energy, accept your own precognitions, and place faith in the divine you just might save your life or someone else.

And for Tyler, there's more--he's got feelings for Will, feelings he's kept locked away. When Will's girlfriend dies, Tyler supports him in every way he can, even when Will's increasingly self-destructive behavior endangers them both on the job. And as Will withdraws further, a desperate Tyler can't keep his feelings hidden anymore. But Will doesn't turn his back on him. In fact, Will might have some feelings of his own he's kept hidden. The trouble is, Tyler's kept more than one secret. He knows something about Anna's death--something that could end their relationship for good.This story poses quite a few problems for a reviewer who would like to find something positive to say.  While the author shows flashes of potential as far as characters and plot structure are concerned, the choppy writing style, constantly changing pov, and lack of believable character backstory wash away the high points from the very beginning.  I liked the basic structure of the story.  It begins with the death of Will's girl friend from a drug overdose, and then each chapter moves the story forward so many days, i.e., Chapter 3, 4 days later.  Not a bad idea but each time frame is a different amount of days, so that it is Will at 8 days of recovering or to 14 days later, not that much of a difference to divide it up into chapters.  Good idea poor execution.  I also had trouble with the dialog, most of the time I had to double check to see which character was speaking which line.  Chopping delivery combined with poor identification made following any scene tedious.  The story loses it's momentum when the reader has to struggle with poorly framed dialog and story structure.Will is mourning the loss of his girl friend but gosh darn it if he doesn't keep kissing his partner at the drop of a hat.  His love for his girlfriend never seems the least bit based in reality and neither does his newly found lust for his partner. He gets drunk, runs off, comes back, exhibiting all the self control of a 12 year old, with my apologies to 12 year olds everywhere. Will St. James is an insubstantial outline of a main character.  Tyler Neville has a little more depth to him, but that is not saying much.My biggest problem is that both characters are detectives and partners on the police force.  They are supposed to be seasoned officers yet time and again they rush into knowingly dangerous situations without backup, bust down doors into parties without identifying themselves, past drug-laden tables to beat down a target.  One partner is out of control due to his grief.  One covers for him. Still no matter the situation  both have an absolute lack of knowledge of police procedures between them.  Reading this is like watching an old Starskey and Hutch episode with Starsky and Hutch demonstrating superior police procedure than the two detectives within this story.Finally, one of the most heatedly argued subject these days is the inclusion of m/f sexual content within the m/m genre.  So be warned. This story contains some explicit m/f sexual scenes that most readers of m/m fiction will find unnecessary and unwanted.  For me it was just another indication of how far off track the author went with her story.  Call this a tale of promise derailed.Cover:  So so. Seems typical of self published authors with little graphic or design experience.

If you think sufficiently hard, you will be able to work out the answers to most of the questions.This is what makes the trivia questions really exciting and interesting. You might not know the facts, you don't need to memorize the dates and names, but if you have just enough general knowledge, you can still figure out the answer to a well-constructed trivia question. There's always a little hint that is hiding somewhere, waiting to be noticed by a keen mind.The only true trivia quiz game on TV of which I know that follows the same mindset is Russian What? Where? When? It's probably the second most valuable export Russians have, following the oil, of course.For the rest of us, the books will have to do.This second volume of InQUIZitive, is just such a book. Consider this question:10004  Foaled in 1933, he was small sized horse with crooked legs. He loved sleeping and eating for long periods. Named after a type of cracker eaten by sailors, no one in the horse racing circuit considered him a serious contender. However, he blossomed under the ownership of automobile entrepreneur Charles Howard and the unorthodox training of Tom Smith.  He was named American Horse of the Year in 1938. Which horse?Or this one:10004  According to the Guinness Book of World records, this is the most recognized song in the world.  American siblings Patty Hill and Mildred J. Hill were responsible for the melody of the song. Though the original author is unknown, the Summy Company registered for copyright in 1935, crediting authors Preston Ware Orem and Mrs. R.R. Forman. The current copyright owner is AOL Time Warner and it generates over USD 2 Million in royalties each year. Which song?I am not going to give away the answers. Give it a couple of moments to percolate, I'll bet you'll answer these yourself no problem.Granted, there are a few questions that are location and culture specific. In this book, there are two sets of questions just for India. I really had no clue how to answer them but I suspect a person of Indian heritage would have no problem with those. Still, these are only a couple of questions out of the whole book. The rest of the quizzes are for the Western audience.All in all, a very good book of trivia quiz questions and answers.

She has been the good girl, the picture perfect minister's daughter, dating another minister's son. Her parents have a plan for her, but Shayna has other ideas.

He's home on Christmas break from college when he's thrown into an awkward situation with Shayna. The two make an immediate connection, yet they live on opposite sides of the country and the age difference seems to put Shayna strictly into the friend zone, or is it something more? Is Carter hiding a secret that could be the reason he's holding Shayna at a distance, despite the obvious attraction they have towards each other?Carter and Shayna continue to have a relationship via flirty late night text messages and phone calls, and when Shayna's unhappiness at home finally gets to the breaking point, she decides to set out across the country to see if a relationship with Carter could really work. Shayna also finds out that her parents have been harboring a huge secret as well, a secret that could explain a lot of Shayna's behaviors.

You'd think she'd be apprehensive.  Nope.

It goes into detail and provides a thorough understanding of all of the different areas of personal injury, the complicated legal battles that are involved and everything in between.Overall, when I finished this book I felt like I had a solid foundation of knowledge about my rights, my legal options regarding the injuries and a deeper understanding of how to start the legal proceedings for rectifying those personal injuries. I would definitely recommend the book to everyone who wants to know more about personal injury claims, whether you are dealing with one at the moment or just feels the need to be more prepared for one in the future.","02 1, 2014",A2W847TVMD3LOQ,R.

The form of travel was unique and creative, and I liked how it didn't revolve around a machine or sophisticated science. The sheer simplicity of it very much added to the meant to be feeling.Often times medieval stories can be slightly over-whelming for me with their huge casts of characters and many confusingly similar locations, however that was mostly not a problem in Dreamspell. The cast of characters is just the right size, big enough for lots of interaction yet small enough so you don't find yourself losing track of people. I enjoyed seeing the vast differences between the time periods, and watching Kennedy have trouble fitting into a 600 year old culture was particularly entertaining. Even showing just a small part of her lower leg was considered scandalous!I was blown away by how incredibly perfect the ending and epilogue were. Often times epilogues don't really thrill me, however this one is just awesome I could so clearly and vividly see the events unfolding on the movie screen inside my head. (Speaking of movies, Dreamspell would be an excellent candidate for a movie, and I hope someday we have the opportunity to see Kennedy and Fulke on the big screen!) In the meantime, if you're a fan of time travel, make sure to pick this one up... I think you'll enjoy it.(Though Tamara Leigh has gained popularity in recent years for her inspirational novels, Dreamspell is actually more of a mainstream title. For those concerned with content, be assured that even though the characters aren't religious, the story and language do stay clean and within boundaries of acceptability.)","04 18, 2012",A1S13O7V60UM9O,Valerie ValsVicinity,"Meant to be, 600 years in the past...",1334707200,1.0,True,4.0

I was doing OK at the beginning even though there were clues along the way. However, when we moved to the ship it really started to go downhill.OK, yes, I should have read the description and no I don't want my 99 cents back. That said this is one of less than five books EVER I have not been able to finish and I have read a lot of books including the Bible. Although that is one of the five :)I really was trying to tolerate the overly Christian nature of this book but I just could not do it. Basically, here is the message I got:1. Children a thousand years in the future raised without religion will instantly see the logic of the Bible. Really? I think the opposite is true. I am an Atheist and while my kids know that I have encouraged them to find their own truth. One is skeptical of the Bible and the other two outright laugh at it.2. You can justify killing a thousand innocent people with a deadly virus in order to save a handful of criminals because they happen to be Christians.Sorry, this book just illustrates the problems I have with Christians (and Muslims as well) in the first place. Anything goes as long as it is in the name of your religion.Let's say in this fictional world that God is real. So, he allows, in his name, a deadly virus to be released that kills most of the people on the ship. Then when the kid captain finds a hidden Bible she instantly converts. Oh, and then her, want to be boyfriend, also converts. I kinda did the same thing in high school and most likely for the same reason this boy did )  A testosterone filled teenage boy will pretend to believe a lot of stuff for a pretty girl. It worked out pretty good for me while it lasted. I did not read far enough to see how it worked out for him :oAnyway, she then uses her power as Captain to ignore the (admittedly over the top law) and break her boyfriend out of jail. I wonder if she would have done the same thing for an non-Christian who was not her friend.All of this is just my opinion. If you like your Christian fiction mixed up with your Science fiction then this may be the book for you.

She works with a tight-knit group and has a rule not to get romantically involved with her fellow crew members. She comes from a wealthy family and didn't necessarily grow up seeing her parents have a trusting relationship so she tends to keep her own romantic liaisons casual and guarded. The addition of a hunky new crewman may have her changing her mind, though.Matt also grew up in a wealthy family and was groomed to enter into the family business from an early age. After college and grad school, he decided instead to go into the Army and become a frontline medic. He spent a decade at his job and decided it was finally time for a change. So he ended up training in Australia to go on rescue missions with Brigid's crew as a first response medic. Matt was intrigued the first time he saw Brigid on the job, but after being hurt by his previous girlfriend, he tried to keep his distance. When he realized they lived on the same block, he knew it would be more difficult then he had first imagined.Both characters are extremely independent and very sure about themselves in their profession. Neither think they are looking for a lasting relationship until they feel a strong connection together. The author did a nice job conveying the internal struggle each character was going through without it feeling like teen angst...it is definitely an adult situation and was presented as such. Their stolen moments together were passionate and fun, especially in a beach setting like Australia.

The pluses: The characters were spunky and witty and totally the modern-day teen. The plot(s) developed quickly, much at the pace teens seem to move. It was an easy afternoon read and it was FREE. The minuses: For a 33 page novella there were more typos than would be expected like, think instead of thing, a missing a, and walk instead of walked (This is a peeve of mine). The ending came abruptly and left a lot hanging in the air. You will have to read the next book to feel satisfied. Personally, I like a little closure in each book that is in a series. I didn't get that with this one. Overall, it was an okay read for an adult (3 stars) and for teens/YA it would be better (4 stars).","05 15, 2013",A276FX05SLRKA4,Elisa O.,Quick afternoon read.,1368576000,1.0,True,4.0

Jake, yet again, gets himself in a situation with a woman who isn't 100% truthful.I was hoping to get some answers from the crazy ending of book 1, but that didn't happen. Not only did that not happen, but I was left with more questions! (damn you Morgan Parker) I will say that my opinion of Jake changed from book 1. Yes, he attracts manipulative women, but he is no saint in all of this. I think he has no idea what he really wants and loves the idea of being in love. He breaks up with his fianceacute when he thinks 'something' is missing, falls in love with Christine over texts and then quickly does the same with Katie.It is definitely an interesting idea to only be able to witness Jake's relationships from his phone's POV. It's crazy how open we are in digital form. There are no distractions when it's just a text between two people. You open up in ways that would take much longer if you were forced to face the person.If all this wasn't enough, the ending of the book will leave you wondering... when the heck is Textual Encounters 3 going to be released??

He knows what he wants and is willing to do what he has to in order to get it.  What he wants is Tanya Garcia, a woman he has spent three months trying to catch.  Victor is not an easy man by any means, but one thing is for sure - a woman he desires will never, ever leave his bed without being satisfied.Tanya Garcia is the office manager of Victor Titus' and his business partners' company. She is feisty and efficient and in charge of her life.  Three months ago she made the mistake of sleeping with Victor and now she is a bit standoffish.  Victor's dominance makes her a bit scared because she had no business wanting him to be in control.  When he proposes one week of her submission in order to show her exactly what type of man he is, Tanya agrees - after all, this might be the one thing she needs to get him out of her system forever.I got so tickled at Tanya's reasoning as to why she agreed to give Victor one week.  She wanted a last fling and then he would no longer be the man she thinks about constantly.  I wished her luck in that endeavor and then joyfully continued to watch her plan fail.  Victor was simply irresistible to me.  He was heady, erotic, and his dominance made me blush more than once.  Tanya's desire to `get over him' didn't quite work out, but she found something so much more.  She found the man that wanted her forever.  And he was a dreamboat to boot.FIRE AND ICE is naughty.

843863,B00IO262K8,"[2, 2]",5,"My Review:This book was so good! I've never read Rita Henuber before, but I think I have a new favorite to add to my Romantic Suspense authors list. What really set this book apart though was just how different it was written.I don't think I have EVER read a heroine as flat-out tough as Honey. Wow, this girl can kick butt and take names....and not just physically, either. She's smart and in-your-face and completely loyal to her ideals and her team and those that she's fighting for. She's a Marine Major who works in the spec ops/investigations branch of the Marines. The book opens with her and her team on a rescue mission in Afghanistan and the entire suspense line is built up around that rescue and why those girls were kidnapped. The suspense line is incredible as it weaves in and out of political quagmire. I never knew which way it was going to go, but all of it was high flying adrenaline inducing which made it so much fun to read.Off the page for the first half of the book (for the most part) is Jack. Jack and Honey have been involved in an affair for quite a while, but somehow he and his family are caught up in Honey's investigation and his brother and wife were murdered because of it. For the first 45% of the book, you get glimpses of Jack and hints at how he plays into all this, but not much. And he and Honey are not on the page at all until that 45% point. As a result, I HIGHLY recommend you pick up the prequel novella, No Holding Back: How Honey Met Jack...just so you can get a full understanding of the nature of their relationship. (It's a hot, sexy little read.)Jack and Honey have both worked covert ops for quite a while. As a result, when their professional lives coincidentally collide, neither trusts each other or that coincidence. It's hard for people in this line of work to trust especially when their emotions are involved.Everything about this book worked for me. I loved Honey and her convictions. I loved Jack and his vulnerability and hurt through the loss of his family. I loved Honey's team who stand behind her no matter what. And I loved Kara, Honey's niece, who looks to be following in her Aunt's footsteps. Everything from the back stories to the suspense story line was so expertly woven, I enjoyed every moment of reading this book.I highly recommend this book for rom. suspense readers. Expect something a little bit different, but for me those differences worked. I will definitely be looking for more from this author.","03 5, 2014",A23GRXCXQU3SM8,Smitten with Reading,A rating...,1393977600,1.0,True,5.0

I am a sucker for sci-fi feel romances and Waking Up Immortal had that feel to it.  Chloe just found out she is immortal.  She cannot die.  Don't think vampires.  More like humans that just heal and don't croak.  Kier, the love interest and machine man prison guard, was so much fun to read about.

Bad Guy mounted on horseback.  Good Guy (I'm trying hard not to make it a spoiler here) on foot.  Bad Guy intends to capture or injure Good Guy.  Good Guy walks up to the horse, uncinches the saddle so that Bad Guy falls off, vaults onto horse and rides off bareback.  Oh, really?

What's not there is the incredibly sensual and steamy sex it leans more to that ephemeral love connection, and in the end it really is a question of how much would you give up for love, and to stay true to your word?In this short in The Pact series, we are introduced to a world where humans have contracted with Vampires for blood offerings in return for protection from the ever-increasing Demon attacks. New vampires are chosen from the residents willing to sacrifice their human lives for an eternity as a demon-fighting vampire.Deidra is the first to be chosen from her village in many years, her sire's favorite childe Tristen is tasked with training her and teaching her the vampire way. Deidra can't give up her belief that vampires can love, for eternity, in fact she is in love with Tristen. When a failure of battle tactics lead to Deira's village being destroyed by demons, she disappears.The emotion and story in this short are well-crafted and engaging, you will be drawn in into the world of Kallysten's creation and find this an entirely wonderful escape.

And when I started reading I was thinking Oh this is a sweet story then the further I read I was Oh it's getting hot in here, a fanning myself hot. And then it was OMFG where did that come from I didn't see that one coming. Then it was Oh Kindle you made me cry and then finally it ended with a big smile on my face. I just love books that do this to you.I totally loved Texas Pride but I have to say this story just blew it out the water. Everything about this book is just so good from the way it's written to the story plot the suspense the development of the characters to the love and hot sex scenes. For me this book is the best one yet from this Author.Trent what can I say about Trent .Well his life revolves around the kids, he puts his life on hold when his sister dies giving birth and with the father of the kids dying in the war Trent finds himself becoming Dad to Em and Hunter. I loved these kids I had a few laugh out moments with them as having kids myself I know it's the sort of thing kids say and do. The love he has for the kids comes clearly through the pages and I loved the dynamics between him the kids and Rhonny (the nanny) and Auntie crazy.Now throw in sexy Gage, I seriously swooned over Gage and it was fun to watch the Sparks fly between these two. Gage is the sort of man who didn't do relationships but when he meets Trent he knows he wants more than a one night stand. Gage goes all out to make Trent his which does end up with some very heated sex. And understandably Trent does try and hold back on falling for Gage because he comes as a package deal. But when a shock discovery threatens everything between them and I have to say I did not see this part coming at all life's are at risk and what Gage does to save the ones he loves is lovely even if I did want to smack him up the head for the way he just walked away from Trent.  There is so much more to this book then what I have written but I don't want to spoil it for others.If you are looking for a great M/M love story with a bit of suspense then believe me when I say you will not be disappointed with this book it's one of the best I have read.","06 23, 2013",A1L7ZSJQ6Z4XQX,S.

I liked the romance pick up from the past, but I felt they seemed to flow into it very quickly 8211 I need a bit more angst, a bit more 8220should I / shouldn't I8221 sort of self questioning. Still, they were a good match, and I wondered exactly why they split in the first place? There were reasons given, but I didn't feel they really matched the people I met 8211 maybe they were different before, after all it was several years ago. I loved Matthieu, a real charmer, and yet not a playboy type but someone solid and dependable. You know when he says he'll protect her that he will, whatever his personal feelings...and then oif course there's that New Orleans aura and accent....-) Lisette, a fun girl and I understood how she felt when her family abandoned her, thought she was mentally incapable just because she liked some kink. The blog though.....it took up a lot of space, when I only saw it as a vehicle for a couple of links...I skipped lots of it, it just seemed like Lisettes...ramblings? IMO only of course! Then there's the ex, what a piece of work he was.So its a great scenario and yet, for me Lisette didn't really work, I didn't dislike her but didn't really feel connected to her. The sex/kink scenes between her and Matthieu weren't really tantalising for me, I just didn't really get that feeling of sensuality, seduction, erotisism I expected, didn't feel the sexual tension between them, even though it was ( supposed to be ) there. Her actions too 8211 staying with somone you'd think she'd have been more polite than to pry among his clearly secret BDSM stuff.....thats just rude, and then to tell him she'd been poking around too! The ex 8211 clearly he had some surreptious help from the top, but that really stayed a mystery. I felt a bit more build up between Lisette and Matthieu, and more info on the ex and his actions would have helped for me. For instance when he appears in Matthieu's office, having bypassed all security checks I wanted to know how 8211 but that stayed blank...Overall its a fun read, and will work well for lots of people but didn't really float my boat.Stars: ThreeARC supplied via Netgalley","06 7, 2014",A1X2URS71RRMMF,Jeannie Zelos jeanie zelos book reviews,didn't quite live up to what i expected,1402099200,1.0,True,3.0

First off we learn about Leah and her upbringing. She's a 16 year old girl who is pretty much left to raise herself. Her mother is out with a different guy every night. Drinking and partying.She comes in one day and blurts out that shes pregnant. Of course she has no clue who the dad is just like with Leah.They don't have much money let alone anything else. so a new baby will be hard. Leah's mom actually stops the partying and drinking for the 9 months she's pregnant but she's still smoking. After the baby Leah's mom says they are going on a road trip. They stop at  Leah's grandmothers house. Leah's grandma and mom haven't spoken in years so when her mom says she's taking off Leah is pretty much dumb struck.. She's now left alone with a newborn baby brother and a grandmother she doesn't know. I was so upset at this. I understand how things can get rough but as a mother I can't imagine being away from my kids let a lone abandoning a newborn and your 16 year old you were supposed to be close to. Uhh.. frustrating.That was a long time ago and here we are now as Leah is in college with her best friend Ally and Caleb at 3 Years old.Leah has legal guardianship of Caleb now. Her grandmother really never warmed up to them and as soon as she could she took over the responsibility for him. She's raised him all his life anyway. Leah is a pretty hard worker and i have so much respect and admiration for this young girl who's taken on so much. too much and she's left no time for fun for herself. That is until she meets her across the way neighbor Chase. He's tall, handsome, smart, and a guitar payer in a band who sings like an angel.Leah is a hard cookie to crack though and Chase has to work darn hard to get Leah to let loose and have some fun.Such a fun read, i laughed i cried and i wanted to poke out Leah's moms eyes out for deserting her kids.Oh and did i mention that ending? Yeah i seriously read a kindle and kept tapping on blank pages over and over again. Um.. not nice C.A. Williams. All i have to say is that their better be a second book coming out pretty darn soon or there is going to be an angry mom at your door demanding to know what happens next. I'd be the first in line. :)If you haven't read Chasing Leah yet you really need to. you will fall in love with all of them just like i did.","10 29, 2012",A1FN8ZGEEZGWYO,n.bradford,you will be begging for the second book,1351468800,1.0,True,5.0

702894,B00GALGRJG,"[21, 23]",5,"Wow, that is what I have to say about this series. There are some parts of this book that are shocking, one thing happens that I would never have guessed the author would have really had happen, it tore my heart out. The guilt Owen feels is suffocating, I can only imagine how he felt, if I put myself in his place I could see me doing the same thing but also feeling the same way. How he has gone so long without killing someone is beyond me but isn't this what abuse is, being abused into submission. I love Owen, he is so fragile but has so much love he wants to give and when he is finally given that chance he is gentle, caring, supportive, and still fragile but stronger because of the love he has and is given by Maria. I feel so sick about what happened to Maria, when she relives each step of her story I just feel terrible and I can only imagine how terrified she was and how she longed for her brother to come home and save her and it never happened. I enjoyed the snowboarding trip it was great seeing a fun side of them both. I hate the agony Owen has to continue going through, how his mother still after all of this time acts like nothing has happened, like their life is normal. I feel so heartbroken when Maria and Owen try to take their touching a little further and it sucks Maria into her nightmare, right away she is worried that Owen will not want to see her again, but he stands by her side through many times of trying to go further and further until he can finally give them a night that is just theirs. I hated how his mother treated him and left him without any money for food. How Maria handled this situation was perfect and then Owen hugged her and his head pressed into her shoulder and he said You're the best thing to ever happen to me I just started to cry, it was like I could feel him being able to take a deep breath for the first time in a long time. At one point I am crying because I am so happy for Owen but then in the next few pages I am crying because my heart is shattered for Owen. I feel so sad for Owen that his mother so quickly writes him off like he is nothing and Owen says What do I have left? but I think it is beautiful when Mari and Tina say us and don't forget about Craig. Then he lays his head on her chest and cries well then my tears start rolling down my face again. The last part of the book is wonderful, Maria finally takes the power back, at least for now and they start to make some future plans. When the second part of the story starts a huge incident occurs that is shocking, it makes me feel sick and furious, man this is going to be life shattering for Owen. Like we didn't already despise his father, now he becomes a coward and runs from his sins. I still love the connection Maria and Owen have, you can feel it deep in your heart by the words the author uses. Throughout this book they both stress about what is going to happen after graduation, how are they going to stay together, where are they going? Where can they go? I love how Maria always tries to show Owen how beautiful he is, scars and all and Owen is so gentle and always checking with Maria to make sure she is okay when they are together sexually. It is a special relationship that the author has created here, they help each other all of the time, when something happens that jars them back to the past it is the other one that brings them to the present and shows that person that they are safe, it is a wonderful thing to read, the love is so overwhelming that I can't help myself and I begin to cry. I cried so much through this second book, both happy and sad tears. Not only is Owen dealing with more issues connected to his past now Maria has the past catching up with her present. Then Owen makes a mistake that hurts Maria terribly and sends Owen over the deep end but this one incident actually saves them both because she saves his life and they both realize they need help from outside providers not just each other so they can remain strong as a person and a couple. Then it is graduation day and it is supposed to be one of the worst days for Maria because Darren is coming, well many surprises come out on this day and it brings a much needed relationship back on track and it solidifies their relationship even more. In the end once again shocking and surprising things happen, things line up perfectly, and Owen and Maria get to start their forever together. I can't say enough about this series, I loved it.","10 30, 2013",A3UV7BV3U6NA57,A. J. Powers,"You can't go wrong with this series, it is wonderful",1383091200,0.9130434782608695,True,5.0

It made it hard to see Cora in a good light after you know why she shows up at Stig's house, at least it did for me. Also the story is only approximately 97 pages, so it is told pretty quickly and it felt a little rushed.The Verdict:It was a quick read that didn't get boring, but it still felt like it was told a bit too quickly.

There he learns her sister, Rose, is in a coma from a car accident a year earlier. Over the following months Phillip begins a relationship with the comatose Rose. We spend our time wondering if Rose will ever come out of the coma. If she does, will Phillip be able to take their relationship from the ethereal to real?The story gives a real tug on our heart as we hope for the best for these two. We want Phillip and Rose's love to blossom, but the obstacles look insurmountable.If you like sweet fairy tale romances, this is definitely for you.","07 7, 2013",AUC99E4LJ62XF,Fiona,Play on Words,1373155200,1.0,True,5.0

That said, it was a very poorly executed story.  It is a terrible HEA it has some potential as a crime story however, no mystery crime story.  This story reminded me of a soap opera perhaps the author is in the wrong business?This is a story about 2 h and 2 H Alex and Sebastian and Caroline and Peter.  The author gave both sets of character's equal weight and did a poor job of character and story development.  The author  made Alex, who is a successful business woman and Sebastian, who is a venture capitalist, unable to have a simple conversation about the reason why they broke up when they were teenagers.  The author then spends the rest of the book with the h hinting at their relationship and angst, angst and more angst and displaced anger.  To me, this did not invite reader investment in the character.This author then spends approximately the entire book  96% of the book, avoiding this conversation and spends 4 % of the book creating this conversation and an instantaneously HEA. Seriously?  Really?  In addition, the author spends approximately 1/3 of the book waxing on about interior design and architecture, blah, blah, blah....I was bored and skipped through many of her descriptions.  Some description would be appropriate  however, this was overkill.  This does not leave room for a thoughtful development of the characters, which allowed for reader investment into the story.Now I see that the author is thinking about writing a sequel about Caroline and Peter.  Does the author really believe that once reading about Caroline a  cheating, vain, self-absorbed, egotistic,  selfish character and Peter a potential psychopath, that a sequel would be  enjoyable?  I think this author needs to go back to drawing table and start all over again.","04 28, 2013",ACY20CMVD4A86,Sonia,True Colours,1367107200,0.7777777777777778,True,1.0

Fortunately some of these animals are lucky enough to be rescued by some very dedicated, caring  loving individuals who have an excess of kindness  empathy for these poor creatures.

The crooks will then sell them as research animals to have unspeakable tests/surgery or other painful/cruel things performed on their vulnerable bodies.

Whereas Trick and Cami were the star-crossed, Romeo and Juliet-esque couple that had me on the edge of my seat, Rusty and Jenna, Cami's best friend, were the wild cards, the couple who had my giggling and hoping I would eventually get their story.Wild Child is their story. And while I was initially bummed that they were getting a novella and not a full-length novel, I will say that Leighton did her characters justice. Wild Child is a story that I felt had two completely different, but both very thorough, sides. The first half read like an Epic Bout of Foreplay a seduction, full of sexy, fun moments and intense chemistry between Rusty and Jenna. That first half of Wild Child? It gave me a seriously wicked case of hot flashes.The second half, though, was more emotional. That half of Wild Child delved into the issues that hold Rusty back, keep him from moving toward a future with Jenna. It's about betrayal and insecurity, fear and hesitation. By the same turn, Jenna must wade through her uncertain future with Rusty. Whether she can -or should - hang her star around a man who will never give her what she needs, full-throttle love and devotion.Wild Child was a big story in a short space. We get moments of sweetness, especially revolving around Trick and Cami. There are moments full of naughty, naughty fun, courtesy of Rusty and Jenna. There are moments of tension and heartbreak, and an event that changed everything. Wild Child also provides an excellent set-up for the next book in the series, Some Like It Wild. Wild Child is a story that not only fits within The Wild Ones series, it enhances it. A great novella.","10 22, 2013",A19UT0OPQCDR8,Andrea Thompson,Wild About This Series!,1382400000,0.0,False,5.0

Her ass of an ex doing what he does best is not helping her fried nerves. The fact that the man she is supposed to tattoo happens to be her knight in shining armor crush from her teens just adds more stress to her tension. She knows she is good. If she knew the reason Brian picked her to ink something very dear to him it would ease some of the unwanted pressure from her.In an effort to pay homage to a big part of his life that he no longer has Brain has decided to get a commiserating tattoo of that part of his life. He researched all the artists available at the convention and picked the one he knew would be best able to put his thoughts and emotions to his flesh. He is shocked to see that she is actually a person from his past. A person he has thought of over the years. Seeing a chance to get to know her this time around he grabs the opportunity.Pandora and Brian are not your typical romance hero and heroine. They are both scarred, physically and emotionally. Pandora has escaped a life that has left her so damaged that she sees herself as unworthy of the caring devotion that Brain is desperately trying to give her. By the time readers meet Brian he has recovered emotionally from a horrific accident that left him in a place where he has started a new life. While Pandora has started her new life she doesn't want to ever find herself in a position that would allow her to repeat the mistakes of her past.Favorite Quote: Brian to Pandora.

To make matters worse she discovers that she is actually his second wife and that their entire life in California has been built on a lie.  Just when she thought that she couldn't take anymore, she is totally devastated when her husband cuts all ties with her and rushes home to Dundee determined to try and get his first wife to forgive him.  Unable to believe that he could totally abandon her and their children she follows him to Dundee.  With the marriage of Elizabeth's brother Isaac to her husband's first wife Reenie (Big Girls Don't Cry Harlequin Super Romance 1296) the next year finds Elizabeth and Reenie forming a family with their children.  Now Reenie has tried a little matchmaking, arranging a date between Elizabeth and Carter Hudson.  At first Carter and Elizabeth don't like each other, but the more time they spend with each other the more they come to care.  However, Carter tragically lost the woman he loved and Elizabeth is determined that she will never be second best again.The Other Woman touches upon every woman's feelings of rejection.  Both Carter and Elizabeth must deal with their pasts before they find a future together.  Although The Other Woman can stand alone, I recommend that readers first pick up Reenie's story, Big Girl's Don't Cry (Harlequin Super Romance 1296), as it is not only a great read but also will adds the background to this story. Brenda Novak has written a romance with truly complex relationships that keep the reader turning the pages and keeps them engrossed in the story until the last page.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","08 20, 2006",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,The Other Woman-Joyfully Recommended Read,1156032000,1.0,True,5.0

Christopher (Kit) Penrose, who recently lost his ship and crew, takes a job as a valet for a traveling elderly gentleman. The ship is attacked by pirates who take Kit captive due to his sailing capabilities. Le Griffe (Griffin) is the pirate ship captain who actually has a strong belief in honor and rules. As Kit spends more time on the ship, he finds many of his own values and beliefs being brought into question.The entire story is told from Kit's perspective. Kit is a nice character who has a lot of experience on the sea, but he is still pretty naive about life. There is a huge cast of interesting characters in this saga, providing plenty of opportunity for adventure. Some parts of the story were a little challenging to read if you aren't familiar with shipping terms. The majority of the story was Kit telling us what was happening on the ship with some touches of Kit's thoughts and feelings.While the story was well written, and the author did a nice job making the adventure seem somewhat exciting, this didn't work at all as a romance novel. The only real romance happening was between Lewis and Protheroe, who made it abundantly clear that they were truly in love with each other. Kit and Griffin had feelings for each other, but there were almost no conversations that we were privy to that would explain why they were attracted to each other. They spent a good portion of the book upset with each other for one reason or another. A few stolen kisses and quick sex scenes do not qualify as a romance.If you are looking for an exciting tale of pirates and life on the sea, this is a well written tale of one man's journey.Reviewed by KindleRomancefor TheRomanceReviews.com","07 3, 2013",A5JZNVV4TEAWU,Carole The Romance Reviews,Well written,1372809600,1.0,True,3.0

Especially when your father, the pack alpha, is a brutal, psychotic mess whose only interaction with you is to issue orders on your birthday every year, then walk away. And things are made even more difficult when you can8217t seem to manage your shifts, making the thought of saving yourself from the situation even more impossible.Hated by her own father and marginalized by her father8217s repressive, misogynist pack, Terra struggles with her change and, when her father demands on her sixteenth birthday that she be mated and bred, Terra finally gathers her strength and flees her fathers hateful pack. Now on her own, life as the equivalent of a teenaged runaway is hard, cold, and more often hungry than not. Then, when the unthinkable happens, Terra knows that it is time to step up and bring her wolf under control 8211 to lock her away and life solely in the human world.Flash forward ten years, and we find Terra curled up in a chair in a bookstore, intent on a Patricia Briggs novel. If she can8217t have a pack, she can at least read about them, right? But again, fate deals her a blow as a pair of werewolves, an alpha 8211 on leash of all things and his beta walk into the bookstore, and straight into Terra8217s life. Oh, s***. Not another alpha! And the world continues to crash around her when her father reappears in her live with ultimatums and torments, threatening to force her back into the life of servitude she has worked so hard to escape.Will the alpha known as Wolfie and his highly unusual pack be able to protect Terra and her nephew from the torments of her father? Or will she be forced to give up her life, to bend to the will of her brutal former pack in order to save her nephew and the members of Wolfie8217s pack?This is a first novel for Aimee Easterling, and for a first, it is very well written. Even more pleasant, it is well edited, which in and of itself is a positive. The book has many of the same tropes as the ubiquitous werewolf and paranormal romance novel, which in itself is not a bad thing. Ms. Easterling has put her own unique twist onto the culture, especially in regards to Wolfie and his oddball, loveable pack. They were my favorite characters, from the yahoos (you will get the reference when you read the book) to the lesbian couple, something one doesn8217t often show up in the werewolf/paranormal genre, and is a pairing that I found quite refreshing.Overall, this is a pleasant, quirky read, recommended for a lazy afternoon with tea and a quilt, curled in your favorite chair. The book does end on a tiny bit of a cliffhanger, but not unpleasantly so.

The accident that resulted in the death of his daughter drove a wedge between his beautiful wife and him that no amount of passion or love seems to be able to overcome.  They've grown further and further apart until divorce seems to be the only feasible option.With their hearts broken Grant and Julia Sullivan face off across a legal table.  Julia can't live with the grief she feels that only seems to drive Grant away.  A fresh start seems to be the only way to move on with her life and for that very reason she doesn't want anything from Grant.  Grant's emotional detachment and refusal to discuss his feelings left her feeling isolated in her grief and questioning if her marriage was ever as perfect as she once believe it to be.Grant insists on giving her some sort of financial support but Julia insists that all she wants is for him to sign on the dotted line.  Intent on talking sense into Julia, Grant follows her right onto the elevator.  Then the unthinkable happens and an earthquake traps them together for several hours.  This is Grant's last opportunity to try to make things right with Julia and sex isn't going to fix the problem.  Julia needs to connect with him on an emotional level - but in order to achieve that, Grant will have to trust her with his rioting feelings regarding that horrible night.Dee Tenorio nails it right on the head with this emotionally driven short story.  As a parent who did lose a child I can attest to the rioting emotions one experiences and further attest to the problems it can cause with acquaintances and loved ones.  Julia and Grant deal with their grief in very different ways. Grant shuts down which makes Julia feel isolated in her grief.  She needs for him to acknowledge his feelings and grieve with her, but Grant's unable to do so because underneath his emotional pain is a feeling that he failed his family.  SHAKEN is one of those must read stories - not just because it's well written but because it's insightful and gives readers an appreciation for what they have as well as an understanding of the feelings of those who have experienced a devastating loss.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","02 1, 2011",A2AY83K9N60V38,C.

The prologue did an excellent job of setting the stage for the book and allowing the reader to connect with Zack and Rennie more quickly (at least for me). It certainly made it easier to understand the motivation behind their actions, both a decade ago and in the present. Ms. Douglas had done a nice job in creating two realistic characters in a difficult situation.This is a second-chance romance featuring adult characters (early 30s) and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. While I will admit that I8217m probably a bit more vindictive than Rennie (I would have told Zach about overhearing the conversation so he would know exactly why I left), I could appreciate how she handled the wedding scene. Fortunately, a decade helps heal a lot of wounds and while Rennie does what she can to avoid Zach when they8217re both back in their hometown, she sucks it up and does the right thing when she is no longer able to avoid him and the reason behind her leaving him is revealed. While there is definite chemistry between the two, the author focuses more on the plot and relationship development and while we only get one sex scene between the two, it definitely gets the job done (if you know what I mean). The book had a great ending, but I felt it was a little rushed 8211 or maybe I just wanted more of the story.Ms. Douglas has given us a well-written novel that was well worth the ready. I honestly have no idea who may be featured in the next book in the series as I do not recall any of Zach8217s teammates being introduced and that8217s probably one of the biggest failings of the book.

Duggan, is the third segment in the Summer Series, and very well may be the best!  This segment is laid out in the backdrop of Australia.Tammy Mascala, the girl who use to play, Murder in the Dark with the Onslow gang, has grown up and come back to town to reunite with her best friend from her childhood, Amy.  Amy will bring some of the old friends and a slew of new ones into Tammy's  life that will change her forever.Tammy is thinking back to her childhood, and ending up under a bed with Chris Henderson, the boy with a frown for every occasion, while hiding during a game of Murder in the Dark.  Though she couldn't see who she was hiding with, she knew immediately who he was when she felt his face, and the frown lines were there.Now, 4 years later, in the continuation from the second segment in the Summer Series, they are reunited, along with Amy, Sean, Tess, Toby, Ellie, Adam, Ringer, and Stan.  All together again, for a road trip out of Onslow to seek fun, romance, camaraderie, and the friendships that will last a lifetime. They want to ring in the New Year 2,000, anywhere but Onslow.Ms. Duggan, has brought into play the feelings that everyone was going through that year.  People thinking it was the end of the world, and all the lights going out at the time.  I remember that year, and it was quite scary.  Everyone wanted to make the most of their time in case it was the last New Year they lived!Chris Henderson is a co-owner of the Onslow Hotel, bartender there now.  He is not very friendly, is moody, bossy, quiet, but responsible.  He also has had a thing for Tammy since they were stuck under that bed as kids!  Tammy Mascala is a pretty girl, but doesn't realize it.  She suffers migraines when she gets stressed, cares deeply for her friends, is witty, sassy, and hilarious, and clueless about Chris and his feelings.  Like Chris, she is always on the outside looking in.Together, this unlikely couple, who start off on the wrong foot, understand each other more than they could ever realize possible. Especially when they both get tongue tied in each others presence.  Chris becomes the most likeable, swoon worthy, caring, nurturing, boyfriend material, and most kissable, mesmerizing, man candy ever!Ms. Duggan has given us a throw back story that is filled with sub plots, laughter, tears, mishaps, assumptions, along with a beautiful backdrop worth seeing someday. Days in the sun, with friends, swimming, fun, being carefree and wild.  The characters are all great, well rounded, and have major growth.  Ms. Duggan leads the reader through the maze of trials and tribulations and makes the reader feel as though they are on the trip.I loved this story, and the fact that it was very relatable.

I was drawn to a story about young men, just starting out in college, discovering themselves and their sexuality. It was easy to care about Michael and Sean and that feeling grew throughout the whole story.Michael grew up one of three children, the only boy, with a single mom after his father died. He's mostly a city boy whose mother raised him to be open-minded and accepting of everyone. He's come to university to study linguistics and he's sharing a house with four other students. Sean grew up the eldest of two boys to a farming family on the Isle of Wight. Money left to him by his grandmother is what's financing his education. His dad wanted Sean to follow in his footsteps and be a farmer, so saying no to his father simply added to the strain that relationship has always had.Michael and Sean end up being roommates and discovering how much they have in common: movies, books, viewpoints, and neither has ever had a girlfriend, and they develop a very strong friendship. When Sean's little brother is killed in an accident it's Michael who is there for him and becomes his rock pulling them even closer together. Their housemates, Julia and Evan, are wonderful, Evan being out and proud. Their only discord is the other housemate, Adam, a raging homophobe who makes all their lives miserable until they file a complaint and Adam is forced to move.When both Michael and Sean start to view the other in a sexual manner, they each, individually turn to Evan, their Fairy Godmother, for advice. What commences when they both admit to being attracted to one another is incredibly sweet. Two virgins discovering love at a healthy and slow pace is very tender and romantic. It was also seriously hot as Michael and Sean became more and more adventurous. Unfortunately, real life was bound to intrude with Michael getting hate phone calls and when they go to Sean's home over Easter, they get outed and Sean's father throws him out and disowns him. And, so, the tests of their love begin with each of them struggling in a violent, vicious, and narrow-minded world, wanting only to love each other in peace. Thank goodness for Evan, the very best of friends.I very much enjoyed this story. It is loving and sweet with moments of out of this world hotness. It's a beautiful story about two men finding themselves and each other.

Otherwise, there's nothing at all to recommend about Electric Storm.  The plot was nonsensical and meandering, feeling a lot more like one of those rambling dreams that you like to tell your friends about for the sole reason that it made no sense.  The main character's personality consists mainly of being confused and indignant in equal parts, and she tends to let any man she crosses paths with push her around and ignore what she says.  The men, and there are many of them who show up in the first several chapters, have the collective personality of a coconut.  Character development-wise, they are completely interchangeable (except that Jackson is apparently more cantankerous than the rest).  The plot, such as it is, is slow to develop, poorly executed, and is broken up by random blurbs about pack politics and mating that make absolutely no sense and seem like a poor excuse to set up for a Anita Blake style all-men-are-welcome romance somewhere down the road (not that I'll be picking up any more books in this series).

38216,B004GB1T68,"[18, 18]",5,"Livvy has a new neighbor - a very sexy new neighbor. John is an author writing a very popular young adult fantasy series that he also illustrates. But he has been having writer's block for the past month. Once he meets Livvy, the words start to flow. John grew up with an extremely abusive step-father and has many, many demons. He uses his writing and illustrating as an outlet. When he meets Livvy, their attraction is very immediate. They find this love together, but the demons do not always let the love smile upon them.Livvy owns a bakery and when she meets John she decides it is time for her to have a passionate summer love affair. But she soon learns, that there is nothing easy going about John and her heart falls hard and fast.I wish I could portray the amount of emotions I went through when reading Sweet As Sin. The depth of John really amazed me in this book. When you first read it - John is this really sexy neighbor who finds Livvy's bra in his backyard (it blew off the clothesline) and I thought I totally had the book figured out - sexy neighbors will jump in bed together the end. Boy was I wrong. Because a few chapters later I was riveted to my Kindle and couldn't believe what a complex character John turns out to be.He has very dark demons. He is a very, very tormented man. He writes young adult adventure books, with furry little monsters, yet those little monsters are actually his dark, scary childhood rearing its ugly head. His demons present themselves in a variety of ways. From lashing out at Livvy, or at himself, or at his beloved sister. To closing down and not letting anyone near him. Cowering at an unexpected slight touch. There are points where he is SO brutal to Livvy. Yet, he can compartmentalize, pushing those demons to the back and can be a charming, loving human being. Livvy recognizes this from the start (maybe even a little too understanding) and decides she wants to be there for him..through bad and good. Livvy for the most part is an extremely understanding woman. She has a father who had numerous affairs, so her jealousy does come into play, but for a man who she comes to love quite quickly, she is extremely patient when his dark side comes out.Even when John admits to being in love with Livvy, things are not magically better. Love does not cure the demons - his torture is still present, and it is just another reason why I think John is so well written. Bottom line is - John is not always an easy hero to like. But I believed in his pain, I believed in his demons. Therefore, I believed in his actions.I wish the ending resolution would have played out just a little longer. John crosses some big lines, and Livvy trusts him very quickly again. I believe in their love for each other, I just would have wanted a little bit more time for them to evolve back into a serious couple. We also get a glimpse into the wonderful world John writes - it mirrors what is happening in his real life and I really think it adds so much to this story.Sweet as Sin really blew me away. I loved it and I hope it finds its way to you.","02 6, 2011",A1W5WDICY81WQ3,A. Schreiner smexybooks,Sweet As Sin by Inez Kelley,1296950400,1.0,True,5.0

It featured my favorite theme - the abused heroine.  Even through I had not read the previous books in the series, I was not lost.  I also liked all the secondary characters and will check out the other books in the series.The Hero:  He was a sweetheart, but also had a tough side.  He was caring and considerate with the heroine at all times.  He never took undue advantage of the heroine.  He was born with only one arm and sometimes jumped to conclusions and thought the heroine was disgusted by him.  She was never disgusted that he only had one arm.The Heroine: She is resilient after finally getting up the courage to leave her crappy, abusive husband.  During the course of the book, she comes out of her shell.  She is wary of the hero at first, but slowly begins to care for him.  This soon turns into love.The Background: Years ago, the government created The Program in which genetically enhanced soldiers were created.  The public views them with distrust and suspicion.  Every soldier in the program can request to be matched to a woman.  A match means that they both have a DNA connection to each other.The Story: Jill has concocted a plan to escape her abusive husband.  She submits her name into the program to be matched to a soldier.  She receives word that they have found a match for her.  She leaves her husband and shows up unexpectedly at the base.They put her in a room to await her match.  Rowan is summoned and goes into the room to meet her.  Things don't start off good so Rowan tells her they will not suit.  So, then she offers herself to him as a last resort.  Eventually, Rowan senses she is not into it and puts a stop to it.  He then gets her to tell him the truth.  Once he finds out the truth, he is determined to protect her and tells his superior they are a match.The rest of the book deals with the difficulties that Rowan and Jill go through to get to their HEA.","06 12, 2014",A23AXQM6MBYF89,NJP,Science Fiction Romance,1402531200,0.0,False,5.0

But Brynn is the little sister of Kieran's biggest rival and this is a big problem.  I also love the swim-centric focus of the book. It is a sport that I haven't seen much in the romance genre and I really liked the inside info.  Brynn and Kieran are both beguiling and well rounded characters. Their backstorys are compelling and intriguing and are a seamless part of the story.Milo, Brynn's brother, plays a major part in the story. He is all sorts of arrogant and egotistical and his relationship with Brynn is intense.  They are very close as far as siblings go and when Kieran enters the picture it definitely throws things askew. I didn't really buy the animosity between Kieran and Milo.

The beginning is wonderfully scary because it deals with the unknown. Emma is on a plane getting ready to leave and falls asleep. Although there are few people on this flight, when she wakes up, she is alone. She leaves and the terminal is empty, except for abandoned bags. That's scary.As the book progresses, she runs into a whacko gynecologist, crows that swoop down and tear flesh from the heads of weirdos and then a group of people who look normal, but are convinced that vampires have taken over the world, sort of like in the movie Daybreakers.I think if there was more of the solitude that characterized the beginning, like I Am Legend, it would have made for a scarier book. There were also very descriptive portions that lost my interest. The story is a good story, but I think the book could have been about 100 pages shorter, or those 100 pages could have focused on more insight into the vampire culture.I liked the characters. Sherman did a great job developing them, especially Emma. She is skeptical. She thinks the humans who are trying to convince her that vampires exist are delusional, pulling her leg, something. It isn't until she sees a vampire with her own eyes that she finally accepts the.Another thing I liked about the characters is that the vampires were not all magical like in Twilight. Some of them were more attractive than others, just like humans. They didn't seem to have overly exaggerated super powers, again, like in Twilight. While Revamp doesn't return all the way back to the original repulsive vampire, he doesn't present the reader with the seductive, teeny bopper version. Thank you for that.Finally, I really liked the way the book ended. It seemed a little ironic, given our current political and social issues. Hmmm... again, it was a bit reminiscent of Daybreakers.So why only the 3 stars? I think because I didn't get into the story as much as I would have liked. The too many details thing kept bogging me down.

151136,B006LWJ75K,"[18, 19]",4,"We have all heard the jokes about 'used car dealers', and in this new e-novel we meet one, John Ray. John has a fascinating history, he comes from a family of crooks. His dad was a big crime boss in the city of Leeds, and the entire family seemed to be wrapped up on the wrong side. John, it seems, did not want the life of crime, and had gone away and returned only when his brother was murdered and his father needed assistance. He put his father in a nursing home, and took over the used car dealership. It seems all was going well, John was making enough money to survive, he had a girlftriend he met when his brother died. The girlfriend, Denise Danson was a 'copper' as the police are known in Leeds. Everything looked rosy, until..After a big night for John, he was given a party and celebrated as the Used Care Dealer of the Year'. He and Den celebrated and, then in the morning Den was called out on a call. A young woman was found dead in the trunk of a car. In the tire well, $40,000 in counterfeit money. From that day forward, nothing was right for John. The car was his, and one of his employees was implicated in the murder. John is not well liked by the police. He came from a crime family and once a criminal always a criminal. John spends much of his time following up on leads and trying to prove his employee innocent, and at the same time, to clear his name.This is a story of old, a man trying to clear his name, but there is nothing old about this book. It takes place in present day Leeds, and from the writing we can picture the dark, and often dank streets of the city where crime occurs, and the streets that John inhabits. The writing is intense and specific. The story told from John's perspective as he meets the police team and follows the leads where ever they make take him. The story is about the man, the people he meets, the relationships he makes, the murder and the counterfeit money. As John Barlow has said in  a recent interview,Just as some people try to evolve the `perfect murder' in their minds, for years I racked my brains to devise the perfect `passing off' operation. It would have to be ONE person acting alone, and it would have to be almost risk-free. I think I managed it.John Barlow has written about his alter-ego, I think, the man he would like to be. He plans a series of nine novels- some to follow John Barlow, and maybe Denise Danson will have a chance to fulfill her desire to be the best woman detective. The writing is superb and pulls you in immediately. The charcters are sharp, and we get to feel their vision, and what they are made of and how they are incorporated into this novel. This is a terrific first novel, and I want to know how John Ray recovers, does he stay in Leeds, does he develop new relationships, does he follow the straight and narrow path?Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-15-12Everything but the Squeal: Eating the Whole Hog in Northern SpainIntoxicated: A Novel","02 15, 2012",A1TPW86OHXTXFC,"prisrob pris,",Used Car Dealer of The Year,1329264000,0.9473684210526315,True,4.0

Lanie's sister is a blonde bombshell while Lanie is a pushover, a workaholic recluse and virgin with no sense of fashion, whose only attractive side is her blossoming career as a lawyer.But Lanie has a plan - she wants Kyle Manchester, manwhore and Brad's best friend, to give her insights on Brad. Kyle is somewhat puzzled by Lanie - not by her looks, but by her attitude: she's straightforward and blunt, and totally different from the easy women he's used to. Reluctantly, but very slowly and surely, he is determined to help Lanie in more ways than necessary to reach her goal.First of all, let me start by saying that The Do-Over was a fantastic and hilarious read. Even though the plot is very much a My Fair Lady plot, and resembles a few books I've come to read over the last months (A Reclusive Heart by R.L. Mathewson, Beautiful Player by Christina Lauren and Before Jamaica Lane by Samantha Young...) it is a whole new story that you will enjoy reading for its endearing characters and humorous passages.The writing (which is in 3rd person and alternating between Lanie and Kyle's POV) is absolutely perfect, funny and cheesy in just the right kind of way and the sexy scenes are mildly steamy but highly enjoyable.If you enjoy a romantic and fun read, you will definitely enjoy The Do-Over!","02 23, 2014",A2O4Z88GVCITJY,Anas Neumann,5 out of 5 Stars,1393113600,0.0,False,5.0
185398,B007ED610Y,"[12, 12]",4,"My Review:I just really love the way Katie Reus writes romantic suspense. This book takes place in the heart of Miami. Lizzy works at one of the top security firms in the country, but she doesn't want her boss or any of his over-protective brothers to know how truly messed up her brother Benny is. A few months ago, she broke up with Porter because he couldn't accept her brother's presence in her life. So when Benny calls for help, Lizzy rushes to his aid and headlong into some serious trouble with the Miami crime boss. Luckily, Porter had a feeling that something wasn't right, so he had a tracker on her.This book is nonstop heartstopping action from page one and I really did not ever want to put it down. Such a mistake to start this book on one of my busiest days of this year...hehe.This was a different type of relationship from what you normally find in romance novels. Porter and Lizzy dated for a couple of months before she broke it off, but they were never intimate. That happened a few months before the book takes place. They may not be an item anymore, but that doesn't change the fact that they are incredibly drawn to each other. As it becomes obvious, that Lizzy is in incredible danger, Porter refuses to leave her side....and yes, he's a sexy marine. *sigh* Really, really good chemistry here!There's never any doubt who the bad guys are in this book. What is in doubt or unknown is why Lizzy insists on protecting Benny even though he screws up over and over again. I had an idea, but when it came out, I have to admit, I was shocked. I love that in a book!Overall this was just a fabulous read. 45,000 words is just an awesome size.

I don't think there was one moment while reading that I felt the story was a single bit boring or unnecessary and even though it was only quite short, it was a refreshing and much needed break from some of the heavier reads I have experienced lately.It's obvious from the start that the main character, Candice, lives in a world without much responsibility and where almost everything seems to be too perfect on the outside. When fate brings her to meet Mark, a farmer who is content with living the simple life and who has an entire town of people willing to put their life on hold for him when the situation arises, Candice begins to realise that her life really isn't as perfect as it seems.At first I wasn't a big fan of Candice's character because she seemed to be a bit of a snob, but when you think about the world she comes from and the fake people she's been surrounded with it's easy to realise why she acts the way she does.On the other hand, Mark is an instantly likeable character who seems to be a genuinely caring guy who knows what's important in life.In the space of just one day, Mark teaches Candice a huge life lesson and in the end the reader is left feeling satisfied and as if they have become a part of the small community that the story centres around.Overall I loved this story and just wished that there could have been a little bit more of it! It's a truly fun novella to read when you feel like a bit of time-out and will leave you with that feel-good vibe at the end.","12 1, 2012",A2AAAZKAJ9KHHG,Beagle Book Space Michelle,A Fun and Feel-Good Read,1354320000,1.0,True,5.0

Now first let me say the cover is not what I could pick for this book. It just doesn't seem to go with the story for me.This was a page turner and left me going what the heck is going on. I had a feeling of who the bad guy was, but when it was revealed it was LIKE OH MY! Are you serious?  You have Sophie who is head over heels with feelings for the new guy Spencer! Spencer is just trying to forget all women as he has had some bad experiences. When the relationship blooms into something more serious, well that is when Sophie is put into the crossfire of the person who wants her for himself. Spencer will do whatever it takes just to keep her safe which is what we want a guy to do right? I love Sophie's friends them two were a hoot to read about. You have Lauren who is the friend you want to have your back as she is a wild one who speaks her mind! Jess is more quiet laid back which is cool.The writing of the story is just awesome. The sarcastic comments between Sophie and Spencer were quite funny!There is no bad language in the book which is hard to find in a YA now a days. If you are looking for a book that has NO paranormal, spicy ( I mean pretty much not there just a lot of touchy) romance, a mystery, page turner. Then you have to get this book.*POSSIBLE SPOILER*There is a part where Sophie is at a party and things occur, she ends up screaming. Now her friend Lauren doesn't come running. Which I found really weird, I mean if I am at a party with my best friend and I end up screaming bet your bottom dollar my best friend is going to come running, just to check out what is going on.Another thing that bothered me was Sophie's mother.

To date I have loved more of her 'taboo' books. I feel like the heart in them in just pure. It is all those forbidden loves you hear about all the time and people are so judgey about. Yet they all work out in Jenika's world.I found this book as a whole to be my favorite. It is not more sexy than Lucie's book, however, I think the full circle themes in this book resonated more with me as a reader. I attached myself a lot more to Mona as a lead female. I felt like she was smart, strong, and her vulnerable moments were written so real that they made me want to cry for her. My impulse to save her and smack Issac was fierce. Only because his rational that Holly would make a better partner for him was literally the most male thing for him to do.The sex scenes were not as dominant for me in this book therefore I was able to connect with everyone and their dramas a lot better. I wasn't bored, and I read this in a few hours I believe.Great installment and it just proves that taboo erotica can be written classy and doesn't deserve any sort of 'ban' on it when written as beautifully as Jenika has.","10 16, 2013",ASLSCL3KWHFSE,Future Slayer Girl (aka: kitten),Great taboo story with lots of heart...,1381881600,0.0,False,4.0

832221,B00IHCC5JC,"[0, 0]",4,"When I first saw the promotion for this book in an email from Entangled Publishing, I almost dismissed it. The cover screams Twilight, in my opinion - pretty skinny girl with dark hair with an equally attractive man who's pale, almost in a vampirish way, positioned above a title that would have been perfect for a sequel to Breaking Dawn. However, I chose to obey the old adage admonishing us to never judge a book by its cover, and read the description accompanying the cover. The premise, I found, was nothing like Twilight, and actually sounded quite original and intriguing. Plus, it had the added bonus of the student-and-hot-teacher trope, which I've actually never read but I was interested in being introduced to. So, I decided to sign up for the review copy and now here I am, posting my review a tad bit later than I intended (but still within a week of the book's release) - sorry Entangled!I think I'll go ahead and start with what I didn't like. For starters, I think that the book would have greatly benefited from being written in third person limited rather than first person. I understand that Jocelyn Adams wanted us to get inside Addison's head, but frankly, Addison annoyed me to no end. Her narration struck me as immature and whiny, and her attempts at sarcasm and wit just did not work at all. I believe that conveying the story in third person would have diluted Addison's personality a bit and maybe I would have liked her more - because, truthfully, she's not a completely unlikable character. She's got spunk and I always appreciate that. I think it's just a matter of spending too much time in her head. It definitely got old.Also, there was a lot of info-dumping. Adams has created a world that's very different from any that I've read about thus far and it makes sense that she needed to find a way to convey how things worked to her reader efficiently, so she could get on to the actual meat of the story. Unfortunately, this did result in rushed storytelling and info dumping, which left me feeling very overwhelmed and confused.I was also uncertain about Asher and Addison's relationship. It was so weird. I think that Adams was going for the whole there's a fine line between love and hate thing, but the indecision about how each character felt for the other was frustrating. I think it's safe to say that for the vast majority of the book, they hated each other. This hatred would be punctuated with moments of mutual attraction that would result in Addison thinking, Hmm, maybe something could happen with this guy? and then Asher would do something to upset her and they'd go right back to hating each other. Truthfully, there really wasn't much attraction between them aside from physical attraction - Asher and Addison had very little in common and they were constantly putting each other down. Towards the end of the book, when we got more information on Asher's history, the attraction did start to make a bit more sense, but I'd still say that for the majority of the book, they only were semi-interested into each other because they felt physically drawn to each other. And while sexual tension is great for fueling emotional drama, it's not really what stable, healthy relationships are built from.As I mentioned, I really liked the premise of Adams' story. It took me most of the book to realize this, but it's actually a take on angels vs. demons that has successfully excluded religion from the plot. I'm not anti-religion (I'm actually pretty active in practicing my faith), but most romance novels that I've read that take on the angels and demons issue completely fail to mention God, and, frankly, if God's absent, what's the point of angels and demons? Well, Adams circumvents this issue by renaming the supernatural entities. The demons are known as wraiths and they don't really resemble demons - when Addison sees one, she describes it as half-man, half-bug. But like demons, wraiths possess humans and then, instead of trying to corrupt their souls and take them to hell as a demon would, they try to use that human's body to create as much destruction and pain in the lives of other humans as they possibly can - which actually isn't too far from what a demon would do. Wraiths are combatted by guardians - they have other titles and ranks within their organization, but collectively they're called guardians and their goal is to kill these wraiths and prevent them from attacking humans. Instead of living in heaven and hell, wraiths and guardians exist in alternate dimensions. The guardians' domain does not resemble Heaven, but instead is essentially a stark, gray barracks. When Addison is recruited by the guardians, she finds that they actually are having some pretty serious internal issues and it basically falls to her to fix them. It took me so long to realize that this was the actual premise of the book because there was so much info-dumping. But once I figured it out, I was like OMG that is SO cool.The story itself was compelling enough to motivate me to read it quickly, even with its flaws. I honestly had such a struggle to put it down, and I only did that when necessary (examples: sleep, church, etc.). I definitely want to read future books because the ending was a fantastic cliff hanger. It was completely unlike the ending of any other romance novel that I have ever read.If you're looking for a different take on supernatural romance, I think that you should consider giving Darkside Sun a try. It is imperfect and there were definitely parts of it that I was not fond of, but I couldn't put it down and I thought that it was very original.

It turned out to be a decent read with one aspect of the story souring me on it somewhat.  I will say that what set up my hackles may not be a problem for someone else.The story is told from the point of view of Faith, a gal who works as a employment agency officer and a lonely woman who has been burned by men in the past and had a really traumatic experience in highschool that included the hero.  Faith is bitterly affected when she sets eyes on Jayden Moore for the first time in years.It is also told from the perspective of the hero, Jayden.  Jayden is a rare and special hero.  He is a hero that is not in the common way.  Jayden has CP as a result of being in an automobile accident as a baby that killed his mother and then he undergoes steady and severe emotional and verbal abuse from his step mother and younger sister his entire life.  But he survives and thrives to a certain extent when he becomes a successful businessman.  Now he wants more than anything to find a woman who can love him and he wants that woman to be Faith.Jayden enters Faith's adult life when he comes to her office in hopes of getting her help to hire a secretary for his accounting firm.  Faith is suspicious and prickly Jayden is nervous and socially inept.  There are some back and forth exchanges and misunderstandings before one night brings them together and gives them a chance to air out their differences and correct the misconceptions.  But later one more hurdle comes that may end any chances they have together for good.The plot was good.  I was intrigued how a terrible high school incident was used both to bring the couple to each other's attention for the first time is also responsible for causing much harm for them too.As I said before, I enjoyed the refreshing change of the male character having a meek personality.  Some, who prefer strong, self-assured men who've got it together and are sexually experienced, will have trouble accepting Jayden, but I was truly rooting for him.  I enjoyed seeing love transform him.Possible spoilers****The character that I had issues with and the reason this story wasn't a complete hit with me, was Faith.  Much of the time she came across to me as just mean and selfish.  I do get that there might have been unease about seeing someone she has every reason to be uncomfortable around (the past incident was embarrassing and scary for her) and I do get that she got burned by a jerk, but she was way over the top in her willful ignorance much of the time.  She knows she was drugged by Janelle, Jayden's sister,and left in his bed (Thus hello, Faith! You're viewing things through a drug impaired view).she knows that Janelle and her friends let themselves into Jayden's apartment while he's away to party and trash it (and Faith even has a thought that he might have a reason to be angry when he comes home to that and a naked girl in his bed).She knows Janelle is bad news (so why trust her about her brother or lump him in with her just because he's her brother)Seeing a pattern here!  She KNOWs these things, but refuses to entertain the idea that Jayden might be just as big a victim of that night as herself.Then as an adult her trusted friend/neighbor tells her of Jayden's disabilities and stellar character as an employer, but in the face of all this she willfully refuses to get the whole story about that past situation, determines that Jayden can only want to be with her just to sleep with her or humiliate her farther, and then of course everyone including Jayden himself must be liars about his disability and good character.She said mean and hateful things that were way out of line and her suspicions and bitterness were over the top.  I honestly couldn't see what Jayden found attractive about her or why he kept trying to be with her.  There were a few scenes in the middle when she almost gave me whiplash when she went from bitterness and revenge to the entire opposite by giving him a wonderful night and after that a wonderful dating relationship.  Then she had a moment at the end again where I ground my teeth as yes, once again, she assumes about something and maintains silence with a bewildered Jayden.Give it a try if you like a to see to hurting lonely people get their chance at love.","06 15, 2012",A3MT311233OHMQ,Sophia Rose Guest Reviewer for Delighted Rea...,Two Hurting and Lonely People Have a Chance at Happiness,1339718400,1.0,True,3.0

In the matter of a few months - Marquita's 20-year marriage broke down, her father died and she was diagnosed with a rare degenerative eye disease, in which she was told would end in total blindness.Unlike many who would crumble under these hard knocks, Marquita set out on putting up her best fight and that she did.  Unwilling to accept possible blindness as her destiny, Marquita searched for alternative treatments, eventually finding a medic who cured her.  With this life experience and courage she writes this book.'Stepping Stones to Emotional Resilience' is a self-help resource, that one can return to again and again.  It is about owning our emotional health and reprogramming how we think and react.  It covers positive thinking, the mind-body connection and the law of attraction.  It is peppered with quotes and stories from inspiring people -some famous, some not.If you have some inner-work to do like myself - this is the book that can assist you on your journey.","05 13, 2014",A837J199AAAK6,booklover9,A Wonderful Book That Informs and Inspires.,1399939200,0.0,False,5.0
213478,B007VEU8FU,"[0, 0]",5,"As a psychiatrist I read plenty of professional publications on mental disorders. One of the many issues with much of the professional writing about the subject of health and mental well being is that it is written with a very specific public in mind: other professionals. Readability is not always the priority and some can be dry and not particularly engaging (although there are many good writers in the field). When recommending books or articles to patients and service-users it is important to keep in mind who the books are addressed to and how much common ground they cover.On the other hand there are books that are very personal accounts and can be inspirational but not always easy to generalize to other cases. And some of the books containing advice make no reference to any theoretical approaches and lack no firm evidence to back-up their suggestions.I was pleased when I read Marquita Herald8217s book 8216Stepping Stones to Emotional Resilience8217 (2nd Ed) to note that it does not fall into either of those categories. It is neither a dry professional book, nor a personal account lacking research and good evidence behind it. The author gives credit where credit is due, clearly stating where her ideas come from, and also acknowledging the lack of research in some areas (like the effects of Spirituality on resilience).The concept of resilience fits in well with the 8220stress-vulnerability8221 model that many patients seem to find helpful in understanding their mental health difficulties. In brief it8217s the idea that we are all born with a certain vulnerability to stress (sometimes we use the metaphor of a bucket of a certain size, with some people having a bigger bucket, and therefore being more resistant to stress, whilst others are born with a smaller one and a lesser degree of stress might topple them over the edge) and if stresses accumulate over our level of tolerance we8217re bound to become mentally unwell. There are a number of techniques that can help (not make the inborn bucket larger, but make escape valves or holes on it that would allow relief and make it possible to handle more stress), including medication, enhancing coping strategies and a variety of therapies. Ms. Herald8217s book points at ways of building up resilience, that she notes is like a muscle and can be trained. She also emphasizes the importance of knowing oneself, as that is the first step towards being able to build on our strengths and find mechanisms to overcome our weaknesses.Despite the references and research behind the concepts, the book is written in a common-sense easy-to-follow manner, highlighting the main concepts in bold, adding summaries that go over the ideas of each chapter, and it is written with the theories of how we best learn in mind. That makes it a good book for a large variety of audiences, those with a good basis on mental health issues and also people looking for good tips and advice to improve their life.8216Stepping Stones8217 is enhanced by examples, not only the personal account of the writer, but also many inspiring stories, from heroic feats to smaller but important achievements, that pepper the chapters and keep the momentum going. There are also a number of brief accounts and reminders of famous figures who had in common their perseverance, learning from experiences and indeed resilience. They illustrate further that good things are worth working for and also that it is not all down to talent and inspiration. Keeping at it also plays a very important part.I recommend 8216Stepping Stones8217 as a user-friendly self-help book based on sound concepts, containing easy to follow ideas, that does not promise life will be happy and fluffy if you read it, but if you work hard and never give up you8217ll be better prepared to cope with whatever might come your way.

246562,B008C9YSR2,"[0, 0]",4,"MY REVIEWI was sent a mobi file of this book to read by the author. He had heard about my blog from another author who I have worked with and loved her work, Shalini Boland.The cover is simplistic in that it has a backdrop of graffiti art, with a black circle for the title and author. I don't know whether I like it or not. To be totally honest, if I saw this one on the shelf, it would not be the first book I picked up because of the cover however, when you read the book, the cover then makes sense. The blurb would definitely attract me to the book as I have said on many occasions, dystopian is one of my favourite genres.The book is set in a place that could sadly exist in a few years time. A troubled, society has been cut off from the outside, so the ill and the trouble maker hoodies are kept away from the main population. Guards prevent people escaping to the outside. the only time you go through the gate is if you are on a work detail at the Ready Meal factory. It's bag breaking mind numbing work but at least you are at the other side of the wall. Your pretty safe as long as you stay on the good side of the guards and the warden. Food is provided in the form of ready meals in boxes to those on the inside, captive Zones area. The hoodies fight and steal peoples boxes, money,etc.The story is set around Dylan, his younger sister Lil, their friend Oscar and his elderly father. Dylan is left looking after his little sister when their parent die, taken by the illness, they live in a flat in a tower block. Oscar lives a few floors above them in the tower block with his elderly father who is basically existing with his son's help. People trundle on day after day, coping with the monotony and fear, hoping to avoid the hoodies and hoping to stay out of the line of fire of the warden too. The only escapism that Dylan has is his painting. Oscar has a guard friend who enables Dylan to send his paintings to the outside, but where is he sending them? Do they even get there? Does that place even still exist?There is tension in the zones as the hoodies want more and more from the people, thy take what they want and demand even more. If you don't give what they ask or can't give what they demand you are beaten, often beaten to death. The air is filled with tension as the hoodies demands grow more and more...Some of then men decide to take a stand, but will it work? What will the repercussions be? How long can people go on living like this. Is there a way of escaping to the outside? Even if there is what is it like outside? Is the art gallery still there that Dylan remembers visiting as a child.I won't go further as I don't wish to spoil your own voyage of discovery into this book. It's gritty, at times violent, but there's always a sliver of Hope. This book seemed quite short at 151 pages, and I seemed to fly through reading it.So did I enjoy it? Yes. Would I read a Bk2 or more by Sean Joyce? Yes. Would I recommend? Yes, for all those that love dystopian will certainly enjoy this.","07 28, 2012",A3P7J1OPIWTB58,Sanz,A look into a possible future?

147314,B006IY07SM,"[5, 5]",3,"Having read several of Ms. Hunt's work, I really don't feel this is her best work.  The storyline is fine: the hero had lost his wife and unborn child, and he closed off his heart to love.  The heroine had lost as well, but her heart remained open to love.  It's a romance novel, so of course, everything ends well.So what's the problem?  The problem was the sex scenes and the chemistry between the two...or the lack of chemistry, I should say.  Sure, there was physical chemistry, but I wasn't convinced that these two truly developed an emotional bond.  At times, the hero was quite demeaning of the heroine.  I felt the heroine was too submissive, just forgiving him for all his meanness.  Even stranger, at the end, the last sex scene is weird, almost like a D/s relationship.  Not once in the book is the phrase make love mentioned, it was always the more crude word, and I don't mean sex.  How is that supposed to convince the reader that the two have fallen in love?  Moreover, I had a problem with the scenes after their first sexual encounter.  I won't give it away, but let's just say the issue is with the heroine's hygiene.  It was just strange.Maybe Ms. Hunt rushed this one to publication so it could reach the market for the Christmas season.  It's a shame because the novel really did have potential.","12 20, 2011",AXCAQORZA8BGL,Emerson Eureka True Reviewer,Not her best work...,1324339200,1.0,True,3.0

Neither Eva nor Trevor do relationships. Eva's tough and closed-off. She just got out of a relationship with Luke, a guy who was far more into her than she was into him. While she didn't have feelings for him, her ego took a blow when he dumped her. Now they're both attending Megan and Reed's wedding and Luke is showing interest in giving things another try. Eva's not opposed to a wedding weekend hookup, but she knows that wouldn't be fair considering how he feels about her. What's a girl to do?He was a genuine guy. If he ever changed course and decided to settle down with one woman, he'd be the perfect guy you'd want to take home to your parents. A guy that would shake hands and drink a beer with your dad, then do dishes with your mom. Probably play catch with your brother and earn a little crush from your sister. He was also the guy that would sneak you off into the bathroom while your family was preoccupied and f*** you on the sink8230Enter Trevor Owens: soldier, manwh*re, friend, knight in shining armor. Eva's always been attracted to him (and him to her), but she knows his deal. He doesn't do relationships he sleeps around. They're good friends, but he's not boyfriend material. Except, this weekend he offers to be just that. If he and Eva pretend they're dating, Luke will leave her alone and she'll have a peaceful weekend with friends. After a weak moment, she agrees to his proposition. As they're playing the game, it starts to feel a little too real. Can they have a weekend of no-strings-attached fun or is there something more to their friendship? Could she really be his for more than just a weekend? You'll have to read and find out.If anyone knew and understood Eva's lack of intimate emotion 8211 it was Trevor. They were cut from the same cloth that was missing the fall-in-love thread.Since this novella was told in from both Eva and Trevor's perspectives, the reader gets a nice look inside both of their heads as the weekend's events occur. I thought the dual POVs were pulled off well. I liked seeing the slightly softer side of Trevor. He intrigued me in Feel the Rush and I hoped he would eventually get his own book. Eva and Trevor are both likable, if flawed, characters. Eva's strong and tough. Trevor is hot and protective. Whether friends or involved in the fake relationship, they played well off each other. They had a spark that jumped off the page.This was a quick and easy, steamy read. I really enjoy Kelsie's writing style and characters. I blew through this novella in a little under an hour. If you're a fan of the Hard Feelings series 8211 or of hot military men 8211 you will want to read this one (and the whole series).

In the process the book also educates its readers about assumptions and other fixed notions that we tend to hold onto and which in turn acts as a hindrance to our success.The book traces Jobs8217 educational and professional trajectory, how he lived life on his own terms and emerged successful due to his grit and determination. The main facet that is highlighted is the fact that he was always willing to learn from his mistakes/failures rather than being subdued by them an important lesson that we tend to forget most of the times.

I also liked the way Mildred Colvin focused on the relationship between Amy and Kent without them getting physically intimate (sorry if that is a spoiler).  It was nice because there is more to the actually relationship developing and, in some novels, the author pays more attention to describing the details of the hero and heroine's physical relationship then the emotional one.  If you like that, that is fine but personally I don't need so many details and can use my own imagination.The only issue I would have is that at times Amy took some pretty big jumps of conclusion regarding Kent and another lady.  Maybe because that element would add some drama/angst to the relationshiop between Kent and Amy but at times it made Amy just a little too immature. That, of course, is just my own opinion.

His armies vast and his lands growing but it was not at his own hand, it was led by that of Dorin, The Red Dragon.Dorin served Castle Bran and his Lord with an unwavering loyalty. His strength absolute and his armor impenetrable, except for one thing, his forbidden love for that of Vlad.With war subsiding and a bright future of peace on the horizon, Lady Illona is sent to Castle Bran to bind their nation's houses as one. As a wedding looms, Dorin finds that his love cannot be contained and it sets a series of events into motion that will seal his fate and that of the legend of Dracula forever.Review:Dorin loves Vlad the Impaler but, won't act upon it, he stays by his lifelong friend's side, no matter what. Now, that's loyalty with a capital L. But, at what polnt does loyalty become self-loathing insanity?Dorin has already been through a Living Hell and back before even becoming a hellhound. Try being around the one you LOVE and having to keep it to yourself, then, enter in Lady Illona and OMG the journey of epic proportions truely begins.I absolutely LOVED this story, it kept me rivited and turning the pages as I invisioned the psychological and thrilling rollercoaster ride of surprising twists and mind blowing turns. If you are a fan of rueserotics, you do not want to miss this fourth installment.Well written, picturesque, full of action, and HOT AS HELL!MoriahLong before man existed, another being did, that of the angels of Moriah.Moriah was a beautiful planet on the outskirts of the Andromeda system and if it was not for war, it would have been a true heaven.As with all things, every being fights for survival and the angels of Moriah had done just that for all of 200 years. Led by Elohim and that of El, their army of the Helios Guard defended the planets greatest resources, that of water and iron.Once war ended they found themselves left without purpose. Elohim tries his best to ensure that the angels of Moriah will live forever, but in his desperation has he saved them? Or has he doomed them all?Review:Oh SNAP! What a twisted little gem we have here. This is Lucifer's back story, which explores a time when Moriah was rich in life and resources, a story of El and Lucifer in their youth.It is story of self-discovery, first love, full of action-packed sequences, twisted, and demented turns, full of betrayal, lust, lies, anger, and emotional turmoil. Not for the faint of heart!I LOVE Dark and Fantasical worlds as they often provide possible answers as to why people do what they do. The final twist floored me, as I did not see it coming.

I liked that the book explained what depression really is the signs and the types of depressive disorders that there are.  It humanized the disease.  The book also gives you the tools to identify what you are dealing with and how you can modify your behavior and reactions to help a depressed person through their crisis.  In no way is this book substitute for professional assistance but it makes assisting a depressed person not such a battle especially when you understand that you have to depersonalize what a depressed person says to you and take the role of a support person more strongly.

Instead it's about a couple that's already found each other. It's all about two people who have already fell in love and bought a house together. They're all ready to settle down into a nice and normal life. Except their house seems to have other plans. Because their house has a secret. A secret room that is. And that room has been boarded up for a long time.This book is about Shane and Bayley who have just bought a beautiful new home that they absolutely love. While going around getting the house in order Bayley discovers something. She finds a little room that's been boarded up for some unknown reason. So when her man gets home she takes him up to show him the room as well. And that's when the fun really starts. The room seems to have some type of power over them and they can't stop ripping each other's clothes off which leads to the best sex of their lives.If you love reading hot and steamy sex stories then this is definitely the book for you. It has plenty of the sexy and sultry scenes you would expect from Sandra Ross's books. She definitely knows how to write a good sex scene after all. The only thing I didn't like as much about this book was that there wasn't a whole lot else going on. A lot of the book focused on their sex lives with the room and didn't really mention things that happened between them other than the room. I would have liked a little bit more talking and understanding the characters.After you read this book you will never be able to look at tower rooms the same way again. Instead, you'll always be wondering what goes on in there and thinking about this book. I really enjoyed reading it and I have a bunch of friends that love this style of book as well. I know they'd really enjoy it. With all the hot and heavy sex going on it's definitely a book that will have you reaching for ice water and taking long, cold showers. You'll also be pouring over it unable to tear yourself away.I've read many of Sandra Ross's books before and she definitely knows how to write a sex scene. She gives you all the in depth and dirty details so you just can't tear yourself from it. I'd recommend this book for my friends and a few of my family that are into romance novels too. With a bit of a warning of course.","01 20, 2013",A33I6PERQJQ2TR,Sam,Never Look at Towers the Same Again,1358640000,0.0,False,4.666666666666667

The couple purchase a beautiful country home that comes with a lot of acreage, who could ask for more? Well, Bayley and Shane didn't ask, but they sure got their money's worth.

Featuring Lachlan and Maggie from the previous book but expanding on secondary characters that were previously introduced . In this book we get to see more from the witches and one coven member in particular Jonathan gets his story told in this fast paced and highly addictive book.Jonathan is no ordinary witch, he's a very powerful one and used to hiding his own magic. The witches are invited to discuss strategy with Lachlan and his dragon Kheladin but they are interrupted by the arrival of a female dragon Tarika and her bonded Mage Britta. It had long been feared that the dragons were extinct and yet here are two of them together at a time of great need. The Morrigan is plotting unspeakable evil and it's no easy task to thwart her but somehow the witches and dragons must work together to save the very fabric of time and man kinds way of life.Jonathan is drawn towards the brash Britta and try's to help her acclimatise to the century she and Tarika find themselves in but they are attacked by the Morrigan and have to separate. Britta and Jonathan are just getting to know and understand each other's ways but it's looking increasingly as if the dark forces at work will successfully keep them apart. They need the help of the Celtic gods or do they? Is it possible that together Jonathan and Britta can make their own magic? A magic stronger than any imagined.I really like these books and am constantly surprised by the detail that goes into this series. The world building is excellent and the storyline is an incredible one that just keeps building. Strong characters make this book truly stand out and the level of emotion portrayed is never sickly sweet but feels so realistic. Britta is an arrogant female who is used to getting what she wants but if I had been alive as long as her and shared magical abilities then maybe that's how I would be? As for Jonathan well he's a revelation and I won't spoil the surprise here ! We got to see a lot more from the Celtic gods in this book and I'm sure that Ms Gimpel has much more to share with us.Fast paced, romantic and a wonderful escape from reality.

691256,B00G12TM1O,"[5, 5]",4,"[Source: ARC provided couresty of author] This review also appears on Words.Blank-Stare.comThe Secret and the Flame is a contemporary romance that details the relationship between Emma Delaney, a PhD candidate at Northwestern University and Dylan O'Shea, a Chicago firefighter. The book follows their initial meeting when Dylan rescues her from an apartment fire to their experiences as roommates and, eventually, lovers. Some of the other people who factor largely in their livesare Jeremy, Emma's skeevy and meddlesome ex-boyfriend, and Mary, Dylan's well-read mother who happens to work at Northwestern and has as penchant for Irish writers.Overall, I found the book an easy read. It was interesting from the outset and the plot kept a fairly steady pace. When you start off the book with a fire that destroys the main character's life, it can be difficult to keep a reader engaged as life settles back to normal. The Secret and the Flame is technically sound, which I expected once I learned the author is a graduate of Northwestern's journalism program. This is definitely a strong effort for Hopfinger's debut novel.As someone who's never been to Chicago, I found Hopfinger's descriptions rich and effective. There were several times where I could vividly imagine the rooms in the mansion or the chaos of the Claddagh bar. Luckily, Hopfinger managed to do this without making the book drag on for several pages unnecessarily.Hopfinger also did a good job of managing the way Emma rebounded both physically and emotionally. The fire devastated her by leaving her homeless, without any belongings, and destroyed all of her progress toward her dissertation on the mysterious poems of a famous Irish poet. She also handled Dylan's own transformation with realism and candor. His frustrations around his progress as a firefighter combined with his family history make for turmoil that both he and Emma fight to overcome.The peripheral characters fit well into the book -- there weren't so many characters I needed a chart to distinguish them, nor were they underutilized. Each of the characters had a very clear identity, too. From the life of the party best friend, Kristina, to the quiet, family-oriented Justin, each character in the book had realistic personalities and temperaments that were clear to see through Hopfinger's scenes. The dialog among characters is realistic, as are the reactions the characters have to their experiences.My real gripe is that the plot is based almost exclusively on a set of coincidences that make it difficult for me to suspend my disbelief. I don't believe in spoiling the plot, so I won't detail them here. Suffice it to say that I had more than a few moments where I felt that the way the puzzle pieces fell together in this book were pretty over the top, even for a romance novel. If you can get past that, however, The Secret and the Flame is worth giving a chance.As a nice accompaniment to this book is a set of Pinterest boards the author created to give depth to the characters. Perusing this shows some great visuals that will help give insight into Emma and Dylan's personalities, styles, and careers. I especially liked The Mansion board -- see what amazing ways the main setting of the book could be decorated in real life. I didn't really look at this until after I was about 2/3 of the way through the book and it does create some spoilers, so I recommend waiting until you've finished to peruse it.","11 4, 2013",A76AGQMZTPI27,Amazon Customer,A solid debut romance,1383523200,1.0,True,4.0

Payton Pruit, a young doctor, who returns to her hometown of Bitterhorn, Texas for her ten year high school reunion to prove to all her past tormentors that she is no longer the victim that she once was and Wiley Sharpe, past high school jock and ultimate playboy turned local family law attorney.There were times when Payton got on my nerves and I was like, Get over it already but then I would remember that she graduated when she was fifteen years old and all those insecurities of not fitting in were still haunting her. She grows a lot during the story, puts some of her demons to rest, and realizes that she has had a lot of misconceptions about her past and the people she has tried to leave behind.Wiley is adorable, smart, and persistent. In high school he was the playboy jock who had to be tutored by a then thirteen year old Payton in order to pass his senior year. He remembers the past in a completely different way than Payton does and is determined to make her see things his way.In the midst of all the reconnecting and healing there is a mystery to be solved and a bad guy to catch. I don't want to give any of the story away but some of my favorite parts were during the times that Wiley and Payton where trying to gather evidence. One of the characters, old Mrs. Bimmel, was hilarious!I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, fast and fun contemporary romance with a side of drama thrown in.

This book offered me both and as such, I got  double the enjoyment from one read.  The investigative reporter, a young woman named Marcie, is contacted by a fan of her Paranormal Investigation column who alludes to a possible story that might be right up Marcie's alley ie the death of a local businessman turned scammer after he reportedly saw the fabled Black Dog while on a hike at a local peak.  Although Marcie is a paranormal investigator she approaches this case with an open mind to ensure that her story has validity.  Soon after arriving, events occur that cause Marcie to doubt whether the Black Dog Myth is actually true and the cause of this man's death.  She begins to suspect that the death was in fact, a murder, and sets out to investigate this possibility. This inevitably leads to trouble.  She has a partner who is very new to the field and at times they don't quite agree on the methodology that Marcie uses in getting her information.Although this was not a very complex mystery, it was still quite enjoyable especially as a light read. I enjoyed the quick pace and the author's approach to the dynamics between Marcie and her new assistant that was foisted upon her by her boss.  I've not read any of the prior books in this series therefore I felt at a slight disadvantage surrounding the past history between Marcie and Amanda, the main editor for the magazine. I believe that this factored into my only complaint. I just couldn't get into  the chapters that dealt with Amanda's insecurities toward marriage. I felt that Amanda's love life was a distraction from the real story. Perhaps if I had read prior novels, I would have appreciated the news about Amanda a bit more. Nevertheless, despite this one distraction, I enjoyed the novel and might be persuaded to read another in this series. The book was well edited and fortunately also spellchecked! That is always a bonus.So is the Black Dog Myth true? I will leave that to you to discover yourself as I would never dream of revealing any of the plot in my review. I would recommend this novel to fans of mysteries and the paranormal.","09 5, 2013",A1X0TT5NUXPNBI,Jaxs Jaxs,Black Dog a killer?,1378339200,1.0,True,4.0

Her best friend is a vampire and her new boyfriend is a werewolf, cementing the fact that the Supernatural world truly exists within the confines of her mind. She survived an attack against her by the Acta Sanctorum, a vicious group that believes that all vampires must be wiped out at all costs. While she didn't come out of the encounter completely unscathed, she's grateful for the fact that she's still alive and kicking.The only good thing about her ordeal is the fact that she got to meet the lovely Aiden. His good looks and charm caught her attention from the get-go and she knows she'll do anything to keep his attention riveted on her, no matter what. Yet as their relationship progresses, Fallon soon realizes that a human living within a werewolf world has some serious disadvantages.While Aiden may be the Alpha of his pack, there are those that see her as a threat. In their eyes, she's not worthy of taking the position of becoming the pack's female Alpha. Her humanity adds a thorn to the packs side as they see it as a serious weakness. She knows that she'll need to make a decision as to whether she'll remain a human or convert to a werewolf. Yet deep inside, she knows she's not quite ready for that type of commitment.Her love for Aiden grows further every day. She knows he's the one who completes her in every way possible. Yet the thought of dying within the transition in becoming a werewolf, or a vampire, for that matter, frightens her. Aiden has been nothing but patient with her and he's willing to step aside from becoming Alpha if it's what will truly make her happy. Fallon knows that leading the pack is something he can do very well. She's seen him in action many times and she's proud of him in every way possible. Yet she cannot allow him to walk away from the one thing that brings him the utmost joy.As tensions mount and attempts on her life are made, Fallon soon realizes that she'll need to take the bull by its horn and make a decision that will either make or break her. Granted, whatever decision she makes, it'll definitely be a difficult one. She's unwilling to bow to the pack's forceful demands and soon finds it within herself to rise to the occasion. All's fair in love and war, she surmises, and vows to show those who are against her exactly what she's made of.Moonlight is another great addition to the Immortalis series. I truly enjoyed this quick and very invigorating read. The story flows along very well nicely and it was delightful to see Fallon's side of the story. The hot and sexy scenes between her and Aiden were very well written. If you haven't had a chance in reading this great series, you should definitely check it out. You'll enjoy it just as much as I did, I'm sure.Please Note: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","09 30, 2012",AAZ1SFT4AD94U,N.

102092,B005IAQD26,"[1, 2]",5,"This really was a fantastic read.  I was captured right from the beginning, and found myself staying up late and getting up early so I could read more.The book starts off with Hope and some of her family moving out to Cherry, CA.  They are a family divided, and her paternal grandmother lives out west, so they decide to leave GA.  They aren't rich, but they are definitely moving to a wealthy area.  Hope, her dad, and two of her brothers (Eliot and Easton - twins) pack up the van and are on their way.Right away Hope meets a few people, and they are all kind of haughty.  She manages to make a couple friends right away, but no one like her bestie back home, Karsen.And then one night she sees a bunch of people walking down the beach, and they are all heading the same direction.  She decides to investigate and comes upon a rock concert! The crowd is enthralled, and soon starts to get wild.  But someone is coming to Hope's rescue, a guy full of tattoos, mystery, and carrying a baseball bat!  His name is Slade, and he saves her from the rock hungry crowd.And then Hope meets Tucker.  He's the classic all American boy type:  fantastically good looking, charming.  And he's giving Hope lots of attention.  What girl wouldn't be flattered and excited?Boy, these two guys, Slade and Tucker, really had me in a tug of war for the first half of the book.  I could easily see how Hope was having trouble picking just one.  But luckily that difficulty doesn't last.  She goes on dates with each of them.Slade and Hope's first date is the perfect teen dream.  Two young people learning about each other, fanning that spark.  The undertow of excitement, curiosity and fascination took me back in time and made me want more, more, more!  I thought right there I had made my mind up, regardless of the story I was picking Slade.But then Tucker picks Hope up for the first day of school and he seems so sweet and genuine.  Could it be true?  I was wrestling with myself mentally here.  He seems so intent on getting to know her better and definitely on a flirtier level.  I must admit, if it was me I would have totally fallen for his tactics.  Flirty, fun, carefree.  Then I made my mind up again, I wanted Tucker.And then I flip flopped around, every new fact giving you more information.  Do you go with the mainstream and play it safe or do you go outside your boundaries where there is passion and danger?So which does she pick?  Who steals her heart?  And whose mystery is more dangerous than fun?  This book was really good at keeping you guessing.  The author gives you a little hint, then steers you in a new direction.  But either way, you are glued to the page, waiting to see where the path goes.  You get to see the characters really develop and grow all while going on a great trip.  I got mad, I got happy, and I was anxious and scared.  It was a lengthy book, but for me it went superfast and would be positively happy if it were even longer - or a series!I agree with Holly Hood, this book doesn't exactly fit into a YA category.  There are some mature scenes.  It is probably best left for eyes 16 and over.  And with that said, I think that the paranormal fans will be happy, along with love story fans, and even some mystery fans.Ebook provided by author for review","12 23, 2011",A1A7YPC6UBZZIY,Liz @ Fictional Candy,Great Story,1324598400,0.5,True,5.0

427320,B00BD2PT8M,"[0, 0]",5,"Words cannot even express what I feel for this series. I felt so many different emotions while reading love, sadness, pain, guilt, humor, and jealousy. I have never felt so much connection and appreciation for a book couple before until now. Sebastian and Caroline are officially my all time favorite couple they are like a different version of Romeo  Juliet, an older woman falling in a forbidden love affair with a younger man not being able to be together. Their story is a tragic yet beautiful story.At the end of The Education of Sebastian, my heart was left broken. Caroline was forced to stay away from Sebastian when his parents found out about their relationship. Sebastian being only 17 Caroline was breaking the law and the statue of limitations is three years in California. Sebastian promised to wait for her and that is the last time the two would see or hear from each other.The Education of Caroline picks up 10 years from that moment their secret was revealed. Caroline is now divorced from her husband and followed her  Sebastian's dreams of starting a new life in NYC, becoming a journalist, even living in the small Long Island beach town, and is now 40. Sebastian stayed in San Diego and enlisted in the military, something he was forced into by his father. While reporting in the middle-east Caroline sees Sebastian for the first time in 10 years. At 27, Sebastian is even more handsome then before. Caroline tries to approach him, Sebastian is hurt thinking the woman he loved didn't come back for him in three years and is cruel to Caroline. Finally the two begin to talk again and both announce their love for one another hasn't changed. Sebastian takes Caroline on their dream of touring Italy, something the two discussed and planned while having their affair in the first book. Both have changed drastically in their time apart, can they still possibly love each other the same as they did 10 years ago? Can their differences and their new lives come together?I found where the two are in their lives 10 years later incredibly realistic. Caroline grew up, she was determined to have a life of her own and that is what she did, she became successful. She didn't really date, she did however finally have a life of her own and not needed to depend on a man. As for poor Sebastian, his feelings of Caroline giving up on him and not returning to him left him full of hatred. He drinks heavily, sleeps his way through every woman possible but is very successful as a marine. He has no goals or ambitions anymore, not since Caroline left. I find Sebastian completely and utterly sexy. I thought he was sweet and loving in the first book but in The Education of Caroline the man came out of him and steamed up the pages! Ladies Sebastian will not disappoint you!Their sweet moments in Italy made me envious of them they were able to take a trip like they experienced with someone you love as much as they loved each other. Dear my sweet Sebastian, you completely won me over in Italy when you surprised Caroline with the night of dressing up and giving her the surprise that might have been one of the most romantic things I have ever read in a book. I can't help but smile when I just think of it! You are in my top 10 Book Boyfriends of 2013 list already!!The ending made me so nervous, I kept thinking these two would lose each other again, my heart couldn't take it. My heart was just breaking for them the entire time I was reading this is definitely not a sappy romance novel. I also really appreciated the fact the author took the time to discuss where all the smaller characters from the first book are 10 years later and what happened to them. I felt so close to them after reading The Education of Sebastian it was nice to hear about them. Even David, Caroline's ex husband came back in this book and I discovered he is actually a really great guy.My only complaint, not enough to lower my rating is the Epilogue. There is one and I enjoyed it but I would have liked to have found out if the two have children or not. I hate not knowing because it was something they discussed in both books.The Education Series is a must series to read. I hope to buy both books in paperback very soon. Ms. Harvey-Berrick writing style gives the reader every bit of emotion her characters feel. With beautiful details I could feel what Caroline  Sebastian were feeling too.I give The Education of Caroline 5 Stars.

So when his uncle dies and leaves his Australian sheep farm to the family, Caine sees a chance to make a change. He packs his bags and moves to the Outback, determined to forge a new path for himself, following in his beloved uncle's footsteps.Caine isn't stupid. He knows that he has a lot to learn about the job. So he goes in with deference to the ranch foreman, Macklin. He has every intention of simply learning what he can so he can do the job right. But Macklin is prickly and skeptical. Every so often, the older man seems to warm to him, but he goes back to being cold just as quickly.Caine is attracted to Macklin and never dreams his feelings would be returned. But when his life is put in danger, Macklin reacts with a fury and passion that can't be denied. After that, Caine has high hopes something can grow between them, but Macklin has never been in a real relationship with another man. His love life has been nothing but a string of meaningless sexual encounters. In addition, Macklin is afraid to pursue something with Caine because of the potential fallout should their affair become public knowledge.I enjoyed the story. Caine's stuttering and determination to turn his life around make him very sympathetic. He's a good guy who knows who he is and what he wants. He is gentle without being a wuss and he is patient without being a doormat. Macklin is gruff and sexy, though his mood swings and his stand-offishness make him less accessible. The sex stays mostly on the tamer side, but I think it was well done. And the Australian backdrop gives the romance a little extra flavor.The story was pretty low key. And the ending was a little convenient. But I liked watching this couple find their way together. 3 1/2 stars.","04 3, 2012",ABUY5XK1R4YYZ,Jen Red Hot Books,Low-key and enjoyable romance,1333411200,0.0,False,4.0

There are no messy back stories or traumas here, no Clubs or Scenes, no real-world power differences. The characters, both college freshmen, are clean slates as far as sex goes, so the development of their D/s relationship feels unusually mutual and driven by the pure desire for pleasure rather than some deep traumatic need to give or receive pain. In some D/s stories the submissive seems to occupy an entirely different plane of existence from the dominant, like they can't think or act for themselves in any meaningful way. But these two really are equals. Josh isn't trying to run Adam's life or dominate him outside of sex there is no question that Adam is going to help decide what they're going to try, and ask for what he wants.

345103,B00A2815HW,"[0, 0]",4,"I enjoyed Esprit de Corpse but not as much as the previous novel Scythe Does Matter because Kirsty is back in the real world. The puns and other witticisms about Hell really added to the charm of the novels so it was a shame that world was essentially abandoned. In Esprit de Corpse Kirsty's evil boss Conrad has turned into a demon (thanks to her using Dante's scythe) and possessed the body of his daughter, Shannon. The police promptly arrest Shannon for Kirsty's murder. Kirsty's not one to abandon her friend and so she convinces Dante to help her evict Conrad and get Shannon off a murder rap. Things get a mite confusing from here on in.Kirsty went through a fairly big character reboot in the last novel and luckily that `can-do' spirit has continued - she must be racking up all manner of karma points. She still has a tendency to whinge and do really stupid things which was irritating. Fortunately, she also has a habit of turning really bad situations around through doing something equally, if not more stupid. Kirsty's devotion to Shannon really shone through and she even ended up watching over her body while she was incarcerated to make sure it was okay. The old Kirsty would never have gone to such lengths. I'm still not sure of the depth of her feelings for Dante because she isn't prone to great introspection but she gets jealous whenever he interacts with another woman.Dante treated Kirsty fairly poorly in this novel by patronising her, doubting her and accidentally calling her by the name of a woman he once loved. He seems to think that because he has been a Reaper for far longer than her, she can't have anything of any worth to contribute. For all her faults, Kirsty is at least willing to take risks whereas Dante finds comfort in following the rules. I found this fairly ironic as he lives in Hell. I missed the many weird and wonderful characters of Hell. Shannon was fairly bland but Colin was suitably evil.Grant tied up all the loose threads with this novel so I'm assuming it is the last in the series - yes, in case you are wondering, the stapler of doom does make another appearance. The denouement was a little too pat for me and the humour a little hit and miss but overall, I've enjoyed this series.","08 19, 2013",AD02QB8MGJOH2,Vilia,Kirsty takes charge,1376870400,0.0,False,4.0

If NA angst with frustration and heartfelt moments is what you are after, then this is that, although it is a little low on the romantic content and of you're expecting intimacy, it's closed door. But stir my emotions it did and I found myself wanting to punch our leading lady's friends, wanting to shake some sense into her (stick with me, I'm not really violent) whilst feeling for our couple.So, the frustration. Natalie is a sheep. Some of her 'friends' are just awful unlikeable, self-centred, shallow bullies who see someone being different as their god-given right to ridicule. And rather than being the better person and telling them to jog on, Natalie spends her teenage years, and to some degree her adult ones, lowering herself to their level. Jack Moreland was labelled as different. But when Natalie gets to know him away from her so-called friends, she discovers a wonderful young man who steals her heart. The old adage chicks before.... yeah you know the one, certainly shouldn't have applied (I would've kicked them to the kerb long ago) yet in a way it did and hearts were broken.5 years on and Jack is a successful musician with people desperate to know where his writing inspiration comes from. Hearing the words, realisation hits Natalie and when their paths cross she is desperate to make amends. This is when the frustration started to dissipate and my heart went out to them both. Natalie is foolish but Jack is a wonderful man, true to himself and has fought for his dreams and it will take more than an apology to earn his forgiveness.All I wanted was for you to want to be with me more than you were scared of what your friends would thinkAlternating between the past and the present, it gave a real insight into Natalie and Jack's relationship. That said, I would've liked more made of them reacquainting but they were a couple I wanted to find their way back to one another and although I was a touch disappointed by the lack of romance, it was still a good overall read and I'd happily read more from Stephanie Monahan.I received a copy of this courtesy of Entangled publishing via NetGalley for an honest  unbiased opinion","06 2, 2014",A1AH7FPROGNXH8,Nicola_1202,"Low romantic content, but with emotion",1401667200,1.0,True,3.0

707582,B00GEEB24O,"[0, 0]",4,"Craving Him is the second book in the Love by Design series from Kendall Ryan. This book picks up right where Working It left off and should only be read after you have read the first book. Because this is the continuation of Ben and Emmy's story, beware of spoilers below if you haven't already read Working It. I was so excited to get more of Ben and Emmy and this book did not disappoint. I loved getting to see how things ended up with Ben and Emmy, but I was also excited to get more of Braydon and Ellie as well.Ben and Emmy's relationship is on shaky ground following the events of Working It. Ben's longtime friend and boss Fiona is pregnant and the baby might be Ben's. Emmy has quit working for Fiona and has returned to NY after spending some time with her family in Tennessee. She and Ben are back together, but Emmy has told him that she needs to take things slowly. As Ben and Emmy begin to move forward with their lives, they have to learn to handle the many obstacles that still pose a threat to their recently reunited relationship. Fiona continues to try and break Emmy and Ben up, and because of Ben's high profile career he and his past are constantly in the spotlight. Can Emmy and Ben get through everything that stands in their way and have a future together? Or are their lives just too different and complicated for the two of them to be together regardless of their feelings?I love Ben Shaw. There is nothing else to say really except that he is absolutely perfect in all of his imperfections. He is flawed and sometimes does things the wrong way. But his dedication to Emmy and his love for her is clear as day. I loved how he really was committed to her, and even when it was hard for him to admit something or he knew it would cause problems he still told her the truth. You could tell just how strongly he felt for her and I just loved how he always took care of her. Emmy on the other hand I had mixed feelings for in this book. There are so many things to like about Emmy, and yet in this book she really irritated me at times. She tended to jump to conclusions and she didn't allow Ben to explain things. I really wanted to smack her a few times, but I was glad that Ben was able to stick with it when it came to her. I understand her being a little skeptical and wanting to take things slowly when it came to him and their relationship. But I just couldn't get why she would shut him out so quickly sometimes without actually talking to him about whatever was going on. It really drove me nuts that when he was trying so hard that she would automatically assume the worst sometimes. I did love the fact that Emmy and Ben were able to work through the tough stuff though, even if it wasn't always quick or easy. Emmy and Ben have such great chemistry together, and their scenes are always extremely hot and filled with tension. These two clearly belong together, and I love how they fit together perfectly.Overall this was a really good follow up to Working It. I think that this book was written well and had a really great ending to Ben and Emmy's story. Even with my problems with Emmy, I really did enjoy reading this book. I loved getting more of Ellie and Braydon and can't wait to read their book. I will admit that I absolutely hate Fiona. I don't support violence against pregnant women, but seriously I wanted to punch that bitch so hard. I hated that Ben let her get away with so much for so long, but it was nice to see him finally stand up to her. I liked how he was unwilling to let her to continue to mess with his relationship with Emmy. I really love this series, and if you haven't read it yet I highly recommend it. Kendall Ryan is a great writer and I love her characters. This one is another must read from her and I cannot wait to get more in the future.","03 29, 2014",A1HAX9F7HY0D5V,Casey M. Britton C.

385771,B00AQKE5S2,"[0, 0]",5,"This is an outstanding memoir from one of the greatest cold war espionage writers ever,  Len Deighton.  It is the story of the time when James Bond was just exploding into an international literary phenomenon, and the promise of equal cinematic success was tantalizingly near. Fans of both have long digested the differences between cinematic Bond and literary Bond.  This is the story of how they split apart.  It is also a great record of the personalities which fostered the split.Deighton has a remarkable front row seat on the action as a good friend and associate of nearly every major player from Bond creator Ian Fleming to film producer Harry Saltzman.  Saltzman and co-producer Albert Broccoli were primarily responsible for the immediate and massive international success of the Bond film franchise and their names are forever associated with that achievement.  This is also a story of filmmaker Kevin McClory, who for one brief shining moment worked his way into 007 history as the producer and rights holder of the film Thunderball.  In some ways McClory can, and does, claim to have given birth to the lighter, more gadget oriented Bond which has been the film character standard for 50 years.  Therein lies the story.After lengthy legal battles which Deighton proclaims enriched no one but the lawyers (what a shock), McClory was able to maintain the rights to this single Bond story and because of it was able to bring Sean Connery back to the role after an absence of many years in Never Say Never Again, which is basically a Thunderball reboot.The story is about all the ins and outs of this affair which would probably be a little mundane for anyone who isn't a hard core fan of the politics of film making, James Bond or Len Deighton.  There may not be anybody who is able to tell the story better than Deighton because of his proximity to the affair.  We are doubly fortunate because he is an outstanding writer.","04 30, 2013",A3EFZZY5DUHLVS,S.

528045,B00CV9I6L8,"[9, 9]",4,"Do dot be fooled by the cover! This novel has so much more to offer than just a poor foggy illustration. In fact, it reminds me more of some of the wonderful literature of the past, with the setting updated for today's European expat community (Britons in Brittany).The characters in this book were the best thing. They were quirky, weird, recognizable, crazy, rogues, criminals, bizarre, puffed up, alcoholic, lustful and nosey. The only real thing they had in common that everyone agreed on, was that the worst thing you could be was to be BORING.The novel takes place in a small expat community of Britons in France. in essence, it is just like a small British town. Everyone knows everyone else, as well as the intimate details of their ongoing lives. Gossip is a town-wide sport in which everyone takes part. Being the purveyor of a new piece of hot gossip is quite a high status position.Into this environment enter two good looking thirty something year old men of excellent education and wit. One is following a hot tip that a an original work of art can be found at a convent within the community. When he drives there, he meets an old friend from school, who happens to have a house down the road from the convent. And so the fun ensues...Our art enthusiast is an antiques dealer, and believes the painting to be extremely valuable. He must find a way to get it without running afoul of French laws regarding art stolen during the war. In the meantime, there are women, dinner parties, get togethers, a stunning police woman and a jealous husband that he must contend with. He is the primary protagonist, and my favorite character. His ongoing sarcastic wit and ironic outlook are high entertainment. He goggles in amazement at the locals as they illustrate again and again that they will forgive anything, including murder as long as the person adds new excitement to their lives. He is basically a decent human, though shallow and decidedly self-centered. He will clearly cross the line into criminal activity when it gets him what he wants. Erudite, humorous, witty, charming, a rogue, mildly criminal and loves women.Estrade, the friend he meets who has the house is something of a cypher. He clearly does not have the means to own such a place. He spends time messing with the minds of the neighbors. He delights in tormenting them psychologically. He agrees to help his friend get the painting out of the convent for a cut of the take. He is a cross between the Artful Dodgers and the Scarlet Pimpernel. An educated, charming and clever man who fools everyone regarding his secret life, which is deemed criminal by some, but even some of those who think he is a criminal still respect him.Now the die is cast and things move forward in unexpected ways. The characters all have secrets - some big and some small, but all will play some part in what happens - even the stunning police woman.The plotting is very round about, but easy to follow if you pay attention. This is a story about being human. It is a snapshot of life for a certain community, but change the locale, the dialogue and the clothes - it could be set in any time period in European history. There are so many observations about people and life in general in this book that it is worth reading just for that alone. Of course, the entertainment value is stellar.I highly recommend this story to anyone who enjoyed the witty characters of Dickens, Sabatini, Fielding, Austin, there are so many others. Just buy it.

It was a bit slow to get started for me, and I had a hard time really getting into it.  After all the drama, and the way things ended in the first one, I was looking forward to a quick start that jumps right in there.  I knew Jayne left Las Vegas, but the whole beginning was just a huge footnote that I really didn't see much point in dragging out.  Once she makes the decision to go back to Vegas, things start picking up, and we fall back into that story and writing style that I know and love.  I had been waiting for Flynn  to make his appearance, and perhaps that's why I had a hard time getting into it at first.  As always though, Jami Denise manages to tell a spellbinding tale that has a hefty dose of realism to it that really gives it a style of its own.

As much as I like a good transcendental work, these just didn't measure up.First short: Finding Home. Who was he/she looking for it? Is the character male or female? I ask this because in one of the first scenes, the main character is smoking and leaves lipstick on the butt. And was the being a real person or a lost soul inhabiting vessels of choice? Character development was thin at best. I didn't feel a connection with anyone until the very end and even then, it was marginal at best.Editing:  A few missing words here and there. Not enough to distract from the story. Easily remedied.What I did like was the cross between reality and the unknown. That was interesting, but it wasn't enough to overcome the main weaknesses.Second Short: Killing Tiffany HudsonThis is a collection of what appears to be a post apocalyptic/Zombie/End of Days/Armageddon Work. I'm still not convinced what the story is about other than the main character is an exterminator who along with a nasty weapon is able to conjure up an energy force which turns the enemy into a mass of goo.Again, the character development was shallow and rushed. I just couldn't feel anything for them as the curtain drew closed.The pluses: The main battle scene carries this novella. It's vivid, horrific, gory, well-paced and exciting. If the rest of the story were written with this passion, clarity and intensity, both of the works could easily be five star hits.Editing: a few minor issues of missing words again, nothing to distract from the main theme.Overall, it's a three star work.","11 1, 2013",A29M45DWHFPRFI,Jeff Dawson Direktor59,Could be great with a little more work,1383264000,0.0,False,3.0

The Choice is the second book in the Promise series and it is awesome. I was hooked from page one and there was no way I was putting it down.  You should read the first book The Promise before reading this as most of the characters are back and it will help you better understand what is going on and all of the emotions.After Sophie and Chase break up she finds out that he has been in a terrible car accident and things were not looking good. Sophie still loves him with all of her heart and can't stand to lose him to. Especially since she has still been struggling with the loss of Jack months before. Sophie prays non stop and refuses to leave Chase's side at the hospital. They promised to never leave each other's side and she will be damned if she is going to break that promise.Ana and Drake decide to take the big leap and move in with each other but where does that leave Sophie? Can she survive without Ana living with her and being by her side 24/7? They had promised to stay and take care of each other no matter what but both Ana and Sophie know it is time to try and move on with their lives. They can't keep dwelling on the past. Neither one wants to lose the two guys that they love more than anything. While Sophie and Ana are at their five year old nephews birthday party they get the shock of their life. Nothing can prepare them for what is about to happen.The Choice gives you the ability to read everyone's point of views. You get Chase, Sophie, Ana and Drake's side of the story. This has got to be one of the best books I have ever read and the ending will leave you hanging and wanting more.

Is eh a review?I enjoyed the quirky side kick in the story, a girl named Theo.  The main character wasnt terrible and she acted logically for the most part.  There were a few snotty teenage girls who are basically just pretty bullies and a handsome love interests who cant make up his mind.  All of this in a town called Hell, which of course has a mysterious, creepy past. This book was well written and I liked the Author's style.  She had a writing voice that you want to listen to.This story was interesting overall but I felt like it took forever to get to the edge of a cliff, where the book ended abruptly. No true resolution, just a tease, then The End.  I also noticed a lot of spelling and formatting issues.  There were pages that cut off mid sentence and didnt pick up on the next page at all.  As if portions of the book were missing.  I also felt like this book took forever to get started.  Like to much time was spent on introducing us to the main characters boring everyday teenage life.While there were plenty of spooky scenes that were creepy and unsettling, this tension never went anywhere!  My final complaint is that the bad guy was completely out of nowhere!  There was never any indication that he was the bad guy, in fact the author spent the entire book building a case against another character as being the bad guy! So I felt like that was a waste of my time and effort.This book wasnt bad, just not what I expected.  This book is a little more complexity than I'm willing to invest in.

She's currently on the run.This short story really shows its pulp roots when Seichan wakes up in a hotel room with a bomb locked around her neck.  In short order, she's given instructions by a powerful man to find his son down in the Catacombs beneath Paris.  She doesn't have a choice, and she's given a young man as a guide, a confirmed cataphile (urban explorer who spends all of his free time climbing through the Catacombs).Already at a breakneck pace, the story continues to accelerate.  That's a staple of a Rollins adventure tale:  things happen quickly, and they generally happen big.Also as usual, Rollins throws in several interesting tidbits of history, geography, and science.  I was surprised at how much he could get into this story in so few pages (although well worth the 99 cents it costs at Amazon).  And he blends action and setting so well that you hardly notice the background information he inserts into the story.The story is a little predictable, of course.  An action story at this length doesn't have much time for twists and turns.  Seichan appears masterful and competent, so any readers not familiar with her can easily become a cheering section.  And the pacing is so quick that you'll be nailed to the chair till you get it finished.The story leads directly into Rollins' next book, The Devil Colony, and I can't wait to see what happens next.","06 8, 2011",A1U360OMVQRPUB,Mel Odom,Good Times!,1307491200,0.0,False,5.0

Sam must decide if she can save her son from his disease by changing him into a vampire and risk him being a 7 year old monster forever or watch him die.As Vampire for Hire continues so does the other entire mythical creature that Sam meets some good and bad as they try to seduce people for their life source. Also Sam's relationships expand as she trusts a friend with her secret hoping that she can trust him and he won't stab her in the back and meanwhile while trying to save her sons life Fang and Sam have found that their relationship is coming to a new level that Sam isn't sure what to do about. Also Kingsley betrayed Sam but did he do it for the wrong reasons?I Love the this book, it involved Sam's family a lot more witch I really love, in the other books the family issues were there but she was so focused on her work that it was almost as if her family wasn't the most important part of her life but this book proves that Sam really does love her children and wants them to live a normal happy life. Even though I don't necicarily agree with everything Sam does I can see where she is coming from, all she wants is to protect her children and give them the life that every parents wants their kid to have.

Glimpses of a Black OP just happens to be one!The world today has every sort of information sorted and stored away for any reference or use. Today we are trying to challenge nature with the power of technology at out disposal. Now what if all of the information and the technology was in fact used to serve the interests of a powerful few? Sounds scary? Then hold on tight for this awesome story!The story follows an analyst working in the corporate world. But the story is just as much about the future of our society and our world as it is about him. D, a disillusioned analyst, runs into signs that show what could be waiting for us in the near future. He is now dodging and running from attacks from all corners. His journey takes him through modern technology, ancient texts and theories, how those two connect, what could be the plans of those in power, and many other intricate things.With the ever-increasing policing in many countries and infringement on our civil rights, the story may not be too far from reality. But just that right mix of fact-based work and fiction is what makes this book click. The author has done a great job of envisioning a future world which is not too dramatic yet one that keeps the reader guessing and makes it all seem real.As someone who is into conspiracy theories, I really enjoyed reading this book. And frankly, at times I was left wondering What if this really happens in the near future?!A story of intrigue, a story of mystery, a little bit of fact and a little bit of fiction.

In fact, it was an angst we all have about changes in our lives. The ghost has a bit of angst of her own, and that drives the story and the main character. Thankfully, the usual teen bullies and heart throb romance wasn't a part of this book.

She's been dreaming about getting into Harvard for years, and now she's just days away from finding out if she's been accepted. When she's paired with Parker Whalen for a project in AP English, Jaden is slightly perturbed. Parker may be new to school, but he has a reputation for being a slacker and Jaden doesn't want to lose focus. But she's about to find that there is a lot more to Parker--and to life--than she initially thought.Cross My Heart is a fun read with a sweet romance and realistic dialogue. The initial drama in the novel unfolds very nicely--Jaden doesn't see what she's missing out on, she doesn't really like her boyfriend that much, and there are some tensions in her family life with a distant father and a very full house. When she begins to get to know Parker, all of these issues begin to come to a head, and Jaden leans on him more and more until they find that they're falling for each other, much to the dismay of everyone around them. Parker's reputation results in the mystery of his past--no one seems to know much about him at all until Jaden takes the time to become his friend. The premise does seem a bit hokey, but Klein's voice is fresh and she includes many references to Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome, which is a book less widely read than the classic that usually are slipped into YA novels and fits into Jaden and Parker's story nicely. All of the elements work together well until the end of the novel when Parker's big secret is revealed. It's one that requires a stretch of the imagination to accept, is rushed out onto Jaden and the reader, and is portrayed a touch too unrealistically. Jaden's reaction to his news and how she deals with it are also very awkward. This is a disappointment since it's very easy to see how, with a little more careful editing, Klein could have made it believable. Still, readers will be rooting for Jaden and Parker, and a happy ending does follow. Cross My Heart is a wonderful romance, and if readers can get over the unbelievable (but romantic) ending, it's worth the $3.99 spent.","02 11, 2012",A3IR2O2V9V2DI4,The Compulsive Reader,"Sweet romance, unbelievable ending",1328918400,0.0,False,3.0

Candace Grey is a wonderful protagonist who is immensely appealing. Candace is caring woman who makes friends easily. She has a marvelous sense of humor and easily bounces back from difficult situations.The secondary cast of characters is equally well-developed and likable. Longtime friend Laney Svensson is the best type of friend-loyal, true and willing to do anything in the name of friendship. Despite their less than stellar first meeting, Riley Davis quickly becomes a close confidante. Brandon Treadwell is sexy, fun and his friendship proves invaluable as Candace's life takes some unexpected turns.The mystery surrounding Pamela Parrish's death is quite compelling and interesting. Ms. Tokunaga does a wonderful job building anticipation as Candace closes in on the truth of what caused Pamela's death. As a fan of classic television and old movies, I especially enjoyed the nostalgic look back at the earlier glamorous years in Hollywood.Falling Uphill is an engaging novel with a wonderful cast of eclectic characters and a fresh, unpredictable storyline. Wendy Nelson Tokunaga's vivid descriptions of San Francisco and Los Angeles bring this engaging story vibrantly to life. An enjoyable heroine, a clever mystery and a beautifully understated romance make Falling Uphill a must read for anyone who enjoys contemporary fiction.I received a complimentary copy of this novel to review.","04 12, 2012",A3RHTYOGSITLWN,K.

Just a heads up for everyone this book contains M/M, M/F, and F/F sexual relations in it.  If you are uncomfortable reading those situations, then this would not be the book for you.Back to the story though, I did completely enjoy the whole aspect as to why everyone was the way that they are.  I enjoyed how the science of everything was explained in a way that it was easy to follow for us non-science people.  The details that were used in this story were done in the right balance.  T.M. was able to describe the world and the characters to the degree that you could understand what was happening.The different characters that are in the book, and trust me there is a bunch of them, were all written to where they each had their own personalities.  They all seemed to complement each other and were able to work together throughout the book.  Which ended up helping them in the long run.My only complaint about this book, and it's a sort of big one for me, there were so many characters!  With each child, there are 4 parents' total 2 mothers and 2 fathers.  When the weddings, and afterwards, takes place there is 12 parents around total.  It was VERY confusing.  I wish that the author would have included a chart that explained who each person was and their relationships.  That way it would have been easier to sort it out instead of flipping back and forth to several parts of the book.All in all though, I did enjoy this book and I will keep an eye out for the next book in the series.

Reading about the horrible things that Sinn had went through in his life it does make you wonder how strong he is.  Will's character was the strong silent type, right from the start.  You could tell he had his secrets, yet he didn't give them up until he was confronted with them.She took a situation that some people would rather stay away from, write about it in such a way that you wanted to find out what happened next.

132866,B0064VVJA4,"[0, 0]",4,"I have to admit when I started reading Alec's Dream by Dave Birchbauer I put it down after the first few chapters never planning to pick it up again. I realize the author needs to give sort of background and get the story going in the first few chapters but I was so totally confused and lost. I found myself re-reading it many times and still helplessly lost in the science and anti-gravity jargon. I really can't say why this bothered me so much because in other fictional books it was fine that a couple of kids go into a thicket of bamboo and find themselves in a world with fairies and unicorns or some guy can walk to a certain spot of the pantry floor and find himself transported back into time and that was perfectly fine but this anti-gravity stuff bothered me.After a few days I picked it up and continued reading and I am so glad I did because it got to the point I didn't want to put this book down. As I said the beginning was confusing and full of some scientific reasoning for how and why Alec developed this anti-gravity blanket with the help from Jessie, his daughter. Alec really isn't well developed as far as the story goes but then again he doesn't have to be as none of the adults really had to be since the main character is really Jessie. Jesse and her friends end up in life and death situations when they find themselves face to face with aliens who not only want to gain this technology for themselves, they want to rid the earth of the life form they hated which are humans. Jesse is the key to getting them all off this alien spaceship alive and get the warning to earth.The story was a bit like what I would imagine Star Wars in the Twilight Zone with a little of Star Trek would read complete with four dimensions, anti-gravity blankets, space portals, space ships and even aliens both good and bad. The weapons as well as the ships were exciting and futuristic and I was never quite sure where the story was going, there seemed to be surprises with every turn of the page. By the time I finished the book I realized somewhere along the way the beginning sort of made sense and I did enjoy the book.The author really has one heck of an imagination with an outstanding sense of detail. I could close my eyes and imagine the inside of the ship and the grass maps as well as the chase on the far side of the moon. I think any fan of science fiction would enjoy this book especially young adults.","04 26, 2012",A8JIEN57TPE94,Sue in CT,Get past the beginning and it is a great read,1335398400,0.0,False,4.0

864335,B00J1P05MI,"[0, 0]",4,"Reviewed by Lynnfor TheRomanceReviews.comAWAKENING is a story about self-discovery and a lesson in how deep you have to reflect upon yourself to find who you really are.College psychology major Vanessa Clark is filling her final semester before graduation with random psychology electives. One of the classes she decides to take is Psychology of Sex. While Vanessa is stressing over the huge research paper she has to write for the class, her professor mentions BDSM. Vanessa is immediately intrigued by the topic and decides to make it the focus of her research paper.In an effort to do the most specific research possible, Vanessa calls the owner of a BDSM club and asks to come in to interview him and perhaps tour his club. On the day of her tour, the owner of the club, Rod, is suffering from a migraine so he asks his best friend Will to give Vanessa a tour and keep an eye on her. Will immediately senses Vanessa's submissive nature and is drawn to her. Vanessa is attracted to Will as well, but wonders if he would be ok just dating.Will wants to awaken Vanessa to her submissive nature but he is hesitant because they are very different people at very different points in their lives. Neither of them can deny their attraction to one another but there seems to be obstacle upon obstacle blocking their road to happiness. Vanessa's school work is time consuming, Will's job puts him in danger, Vanessa is not sure she can be submissive, Will is not sure he can be in a relationship and not be dominant. The two of them learn, and grow, and discover much about themselves and each other along the way.This story was great. It was unlike others I've read because of the psychology aspects. This was not just a story about a woman deciding if she can be a sub or not it was so much more than that. Vanessa has to analyze and question all of her feelings towards Will and all of the expectations the two of them have of a relationship. Initially Vanessa has Will to help guide her into the world of BDSM, but then Will is hurt and Vanessa is left trying to figure out her wants and needs while taking care of the man who said he would always be in control.Will's struggles with his emotional state after being hurt are perfectly written. Will is dominant by nature, making him a control freak, and he now has to rely on others, including the woman he doesn't want to ever see him as weak. The emotional struggles are great, the love story is great, and the friendships of the secondary characters are great. I will definitely add more of Ms. Carr's books to my TBR list.","05 30, 2014",A5JZNVV4TEAWU,Carole The Romance Reviews,Great,1401408000,0.0,False,4.0

Both Adam and Nicki have become successful and have gone on to realize their dreams in each of their careers. Adam is a journalist with the BBC Nicki is a White House press staffer that worked on the election of her candidate and friend, President Logan. While each has had success in their professional lives, their personal lives have both been missing something. Yes, they had significant others, but there just wasn't that connection that they had felt like they did all the way back in high school.While I really liked Beside Your Heart, I thoroughly loved Disclosure of the Heart. The way in which the relationship between Nicki and Adam is written demonstrates a growth of deeper emotion between the two. The relationship definitely felt more mature, like that of two people in their 30s, versus love-struck teenagers. I appreciate the change in this dynamic, as well as the changes that have taken place in Nicki. Gone is the timid schoolgirl that second-guesses her every move. Now we have a woman who knows what she wants, and is unafraid to go for it.I also really liked this installment simply due to the political nature of the story. As a resident of the national Capitol area, personal indiscretions are an everyday occurrence. It seems like we get a behind the scenes view in this story because it is rare that we not only get both sides of the story, but the depth of the story as well. I thought it was also interesting how many of the events in the book mirrored events in our current administration (whether intentional or not, it made for entertainment).Disclosure of the Heart was a five star read for me. I loved the way in which Nicki and Adam's relationship grew and that the depth of their love for each other not only never wavered, but also was written in a way that was very palpable. You could definitely feel that sense of longing. Ms. Whitney has once again given us a very well written, fast, easy, and entertaining read. I look forward to the last of the series, Forever Your Heart, which is due out in early 2014. I can't wait to see if Nicki and Adam with finally get the happily ever after they've waited so long to find.","11 22, 2013",AHFKFSBQJGO0R,Christina,Love across the years and miles...,1385078400,0.0,False,5.0

So much shorter then a normal Novel. It does have a cliffhanger and it does leave you with unanswered questions but it is also a part of a series so some of the questions or who was that/what happened then should be answered in the following book like most series do. Series have to be spread out and books in series have to keep the reader wanting. Well this book kept me wanting. Especially after reading the preview to the second book.The characters for me were well played. We get a glimpse into the past that has made Shannon how/who she is. We get to experience her planning her revenge and how it all plays out. I actually like Shannon and can understand being heart broken and such but at her age I would think she would be out of the age for revenge.For me I actually loved Drake. I enjoyed his character and especially how these two came together. This is not a book you can say much about without giving a lot of the story away (IMO).The book was written well. For me it was a great story and read it in one sitting not wanting to put it down for bed. I didn't feel rushed. I didn't feel like I couldn't connect with the story. Sometimes if you slow it down to much it then becomes boring. So for me it was played out perfectly. This author is new and for a first book I think it is a great one.

VC Repetto's gripping debut novel took me to dark places where unexpected glimpses of hope lingered reminding me that in humanities darkest hour, a small light can shine within us all.The Tearings begins with Maya, a normal seventeen-year-old girl with a very normal seventeen-year-old life. She's on the swim team, has normal teenage emotions, has friends, enjoys going to the movies...and in one cough Maya's world is ripped from her.Maya is forced in a healing center where she soon uncovers a horrifying truth. The Tearings reminded me of a modern day Schindler's List. In parts of the novel that I struggled to remain composed, I thought of that little girl in her little red coat.The Tearings evoked emotions within me that forced me to think of scenarios we, as humans, ignore because the thought is too inconceivable, and yet the fictional atrocities woven throughout this haunting novel have sadly been very real in our history.Let my words be heard: The Tearings will stick with you, grab you, and not let you go. As heart wrenching as The Tearings is, there is hope, not always the hope we expect, but the hope we don't see coming that restores faith, and that hope can come in the form of a blanket, a piece of bread, a sip of broth, and that the symbolism of survival can come in the shape of a dandelion.The Tearings reminded me that death is not the biggest challenge we face, but that living with scars inflicted by the ugliest shades of humanity is often harder.Maya emerges as a champion, as a fighter, and her words cut you deeper than any knife ever could.

She has never dated a guy, because she has always been so rapped up in her life and doing what she wants to do with the rest of it. She wants to start a business, a bakery.On her way from taking a shower she runs into a boy coming out of her neighbors apartment, she is attracted to him, but she is not into guys that do that.

AND this boy turns out to be none other then the one that she keeps bumping into at college!WOW! I honestly when i started reading this book didn't know what to think. I was unsure if I was going to like it but as the story progressed I got so caught up in it. I was surprisingly shocked of how much I really loved it.Does she marry him?

This blurb was totally misleading and completely out of whack. After reading it, the story turned out to be something completely different.This is a character driven story with a little bit of plot thrown in. The plot flows smoothly from beginning to end and the characters are solid, colorful, and definitely not who you would meet in normal society. The backstory lays a solid foundation for the storyline, without overwhelming you with trivial facts. The story starts out ordinarily enough, but then takes a left turn into the extraordinary. The sex is totally hot, passionate, and the fact that the MCs don't instantly jump into bed with each other only adds to the appeal.The author's writing style is eloquent, richly detailed, original, and concise. I absolutely love how the author deftly weaves facets of the modern world, magic, danger, bad guys, and the unusual setting of a Renaissance Faire into a highly original and fantastic whole. The author offers a knowledgable and fascinating glimpse into the seldom seen world behind the scenes of a Renaissance Faire.The story has a HEA ending with a twist that may surprise you.

But if you know me, you know I love awkward so much. And yes, the atmosphere between Matthew and April is a bit awkward and tense at first, but when you get into the story, and learn that there is definitely more to the story and why Matthew was a runaway groom, this scenario is no stretch at all. I loved the chemistry between the two, and though Matthew did frustrate me a few times (Men!) I was completely rooting for these two and their Happily Ever After.Runaway Groom was such a well-written and nicely paced story. With the smaller page count, you might think the story was rushed or lacking of depth. Not so.

He runs his own advertising company and while others have failed, his company has survived. Now he is hoping for a new client that will help push his company to the very top. Matthew has no intention of going to June's wedding, but when April shows up at his door he decides to hold off on telling her that.When an accident happens at The Coffee Shop, Matthew is there to offer April a place to stay and to work on replacing her collection. Of course being together 24/7 will force these two to address their attraction to each other. And secrets will be revealed.I have to say I loved April's Character and for the most part Matthew with one exception. He lost major points when he told April he would be somewhere and never showed up. Never called, texted ...nada ... So not cool. And if we want to talk about characters ... June needed to be smacked. All the lies and selfishness, I found nothing what so ever redeeming about June. Sally does a great job of making feel the characters strengths and weaknesses.I recommend it to any romance readers.4.5/5 starsI received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.","07 2, 2013",A17BEPFB7FXTVZ,NancyCinNC,Runaway Groom,1372723200,0.0,False,4.333333333333333

He definitely holds a special place in my heart, and it was great to have a whole book to dive more into him.

This book follows Jesse as he comes face to face with a woman who will bring him to his needs.

It's interesting how he does his investigation.I'm giving this book three stars because the story is interesting and the characters are developed well, but there is extra information in the story that is useless to the reader and doesn't help the story line and should have been edited out before final printing.

604226,B00EA45DUO,"[0, 0]",3,"*Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars*3:AM Kisses was a very enjoyable read and a great new adult novel. While it held my attention and it had some really interesting plot twists. It did hold some of the NA clicheacutes that I'm getting a little burnt out on primarily man-whores and insta-love.First of all, I freaking adored Baya. She is so cute and innocent and nave. She has spent her whole life being the good girl and she has a very overprotective big brother. He has smothered her a bit and sheltered her to the point of nausea. I loved being inside Baya's head because she is funny and the inner workings of her thoughts, especially when it comes to sex, were hilarious. Even though I felt like she was a pretty strong character, she definitely showed her age and inexperience when it came to Bryson. However, I totally get it and felt like the way she behaved to get his attention was definitely realistic.I wish Bryson were some big bully who gave new meaning to fornicating frat boys everywhere, but, he's not, he's a downright nice guy who just so happens to keep a careful accounting of girls he's had his way with.Bryson is a good guy but he is definitely what you would consider the typical NA man-whore. He doesn't do relationships or love. He sleeps around a lot with a lot of different girls. He has his reasons and it is obvious he is hurting and living with some sort of guilt. He doesn't feel like he deserves to love or be loved by someone. I wasn't a big fan of him at first because I felt like he was a little cocky and he flaunted his whorish lifestyle right in front of Baya. However, I felt like he changed a lot when he realized his feelings for her and I definitely saw a lot of growth in him. I liked how caring and gentle he is with Baya and how much he lets her in. He allows her to see the side of him that no one else does.Sometimes when you take a risk, great things happen--- mountains move, and you see exactly what you've been waiting for, right there, in front of you.Baya's brother Cole is very protective of her and I found that sweet. It is clear he really loves his sister. However, I found him to be a little to stifling and a hypocrite. He treats her like she is still 13 and would never approve of her relationship with Bryson. On the flip side, he has a different girl in bed every night and he is a total player. It really bothered me the way he treated Baya but didn't even tone down his playboy status in front of her. When he saw how strong and grown up Baya really was after she stood up for herself finally, I did like how he supported her and even though he was a douche at times, his love for his sister was obvious. I also really liked Roxy and Jen and felt like they were really great friends for Baya. She was in a new town and a new place and they really opened up to her. Aubree on the other hand is a world class bitch and you can add crazy as hell to that too. She is super obsessed with Bryson and sets her sights on Baya. I loved how Baya handled her though and I particularly loved a certain scene at the sorority that made me laugh.Aubree Vincent is the devil in disguise, and half the time she doesn't bother to disguise it.While I really liked Baya and Bryson together, I was a little disappointed in how quickly the I Love You's and forevers came. I'm just so jaded on insta-love right now and this definitely had a case of it. However, they had a really great connection and I definitely felt the chemistry between them. I really liked the growth in both of the characters and I felt like Baya really came into her own and learned a lot about herself. Bryson finally allowed a woman to penetrate his walls and I really liked watching him heal and feel whole again. I loved the forbidden romance aspect of this book and enjoyed the little suspense and revelation in the plot towards the end.Sometimes life has its way with you. It peels back the layers of your existence like the skin of an onion until the real you glows underneath, raw and painful to the touch.","09 25, 2013",A12ZO1K8ZVRBR5,Chelsea C,Baya is hilarious!,1380067200,0.0,False,4.333333333333333
604260,B00EA45DUO,"[1, 1]",5,"Addison Moore has made me a fan with 3:AM Kisses. If you haven't read her, I highly suggest you give this book a try. It was funny, sexy, sweet, romantic, and even had a touch or two of scary! Right away, like as soon as the prologue, I like Addison Moore's voice. Through the book her style of writing is very comfortable and playful. I can't even count how many times I smiled or actually laughed out loud.Baya is a freshman at Whitney Briggs college. First thing when she arrives on campus, she is exposed to Bryson Edwards. I really loved Baya. This girl was freaking hilarious. Love glove, kitty, penis pocket (a favorite of mine!), squeeze box, ditch, Furby, and yes, even vagina. These are just some of the names Baya calls hers (and others') lady bits. See, when she gets to good ol college, it's like there is sex everywhere. Her roommate, her brother, her new friends. Everyone is having sex. It definitely lent itself to some really funny situations and terrific one liners. And beyond that, Baya proved herself to be a loveable character. She's trying to show her brother, Cole, that she isn't a child. And when she meets Bryson, well, it's not long before she is falling for him.And better yet, Bryson is falling for her, too. Oh lord, I loved this guy. Bryson has some secret through most of the book, and it has been tearing him apart for years. There are a couple people at school who have known Bryson forever, but no one is telling Baya. But it doesn't matter, because Bryson is giving his heart to Baya, and I love how open and honest he is about that with her. He doesn't play games or string her along, or play a game of hot potato with his heart. He wants her. He cares for her. He tells her. There were some points during his point of view that I felt got a little repetitive when he is thinking about his love for Baya. All of the forever... talk began to be a little bit of overkill. Sweet overkill, but hey, he's a young man in love.The rest of the characters in this book triggered the gambit of responses from me. There is Cole, Baya's brother. I liked him, but man, Cole needed to take a chill pill. His over protective behavior got to be a bit much at times, but it was nice to see it come from a place of love rather than something negative. Baya's new friends Laney and Roxy were seriously awesome. I think everyone should have a Laney and Roxy in their lives. Aubree is a she-bitch wolf, and I didn't like her conniving ass at all. And there were some other characters that were all very vivid, even though they played minor parts.The storyline was pretty good. It wasn't very dramatic for the most part, and that was a nice change for me. It was nice to just be along for the ride and fall in love. For most of the story, worrying about Cole is the biggest problem. Other things do come up, but really, for the majority of the story it was just a nice lighthearted read.Oh, yeah,  he groans. You're so wet.That's because we were in the hot tub,  I whisper through a smile.A dull laugh pumps from him. And here I thought you were ready for me.Read for him. Right. Crap. I'm such a moron. Who the hell did I think I was sleeping with Bryson without at least brushing up on my sexual terminology? I'm beyond ridiculous to think I was just going to casually pick things up as we went along. I should have logged hours watching porn instead of reading Yates for Lit. It's like I've got no f******* priorities. I should have read the Karma Sutra - shoved in Cole's face when he asked what I was reading. How do you like my book boyfriend now, b****?Let's talk about some heat? Kisses, oh my goodness, the kisses. Bryson and Baya could definitely tear it up when it comes to the kisses. I'm a sucker for a good kiss, and this book did not let me down at all. And when it came time for the sexy naked time, I definitely was not let down there either. There were some seriously sexy scenes in this book.So do I recommend this book? Yep, I sure do.

594895,B00E4CS14C,"[0, 0]",4,"If you've read any of Ms. Derr's other works, you'll recognize this setting fromDance with the Deviland Dance in the Dark. It's urban fantasy / alternate America if magic really existed. Along the way, you revisit a few of the minor characters from those other books, but you don't need to have read them to enjoy this story.Our main character is Jackson Black, son of a famous gunslinger, and sorcerer and gunslinger in his own right. In a world populated by demons, vampires, and other paranormal creatures, it's not unusual for people to live extraordinarily long lives - sorcerers included. Which leads to gunslingers born in the wild wild west that are still alive and kicking in the modern era.Jackson - Jackie - is a vibrant, three-dimensional character with a fabulously colorful way of speaking that you can almost hear as you read along. Brave, smart, honorable, you can't help but like him and want to keep reading just to find out his story. Jackie's altruism prompts him to lend assistance wherever he can, and that usually drags him into a whole mess of trouble. Like other stories in this world, we follow along on some smaller sideplots, while a larger mystery begins to fall into place.Admittedly, there are times when the events are a little hard to follow, and you're not entirely sure where the characters are going or why, but it's interesting enough to go along for the ride. You meet some interesting secondary characters along the way, including a mysterious demon with a tragic backstory and an intense interest in Jackie.The writing is solid - good, consistent, characterizations, charming dialogue, enough description to set the stage.  Some might find the story a little slow it takes awhile for the plot to take shape, the real action doesn't kick in until the end, and we don't even meet Jackie's romantic interest until over halfway through the book. But Ms. Derr has such a talent for creating interesting characters and compelling chemistry between them (the sexy parts with Jackie and his love-interest are HOT) that it's worth the read anyways.","07 31, 2013",A17CRGVACWUFMN,Amazon Customer,A good additon to the Dance with the Devil series,1375228800,0.0,False,4.0

He thinks he's lost everything, but the fire may have given him just what he needed - firefighter Tomas Montez.I loved the story between these guys - the way they get to know each other, the trust and relationship that develops.

She's brilliant and writes the best damn romances--with make you *fan yourself* dirty talkers and just fun set ups... like a heroine on the run with her underage sister and 50,000 and the cop next door who can't seem to resist her. Throw in a hilarious first meet, all kinds of sexed up goodness and tension, humor and just great characters and it was a definite hit for me.Derek was so my kind of hero. The man knows what he wants and goes after it with some serious determination and a side dose of dirty talk. He's rocking some alpha male possessiveness too. And Ginger was great as well. She's really not one to mess with and was just fun to get to know with her sassy mouth. And the two together. Mrarg! They push each others buttons, say exactly what they're thinking and don't hold back at all which really made for a fun time as they broke each other down and started something up. The sex scenes were fantastic. He's got a bit of a thing for just taking control and could read her like you wouldn't believe. Whew!

Only time, a match making Mistress, and the blessings of a first love can tell. In this latest edition to the Men in Blue series, Ms. Rylon pulls readers into another heart wrenching and poignant love story that left me grabbing for the tissue box.Jambrea Jones, Jambi to her friends, Wild Thing to her lovers, was a truly lovable character. She8217s a hero from page one and someone who I could easily cheer for. I loved her honesty with herself as well as others. She joined the military because she needed the money for school but she took her job of protecting the injured very seriously. It wasn8217t simply a means to an end where she would look out for herself more than her charges. I admired that. When the time she committed to the military was up she took her experiences and made a new life but there was a thread to her past that she held onto: the thread that linked her to her first love, John David. He may not have been intended to be her forever love but the indelible mark they left on each other was so beautifully spelled out in the pages of this story.I liked how Ms. Rylon backtracked ever so often to drop in information from Jambi8217s past as explanation for the woman she had become. Her military training as a nurse and the man who first touched her heart were so splendidly and vividly displayed in her descriptive writing. Let me tell you, the part about the 8216super spy8217 brought more than a few tears.The men who were destined to give Jambrea the love that John couldn8217t were different than him but no less heroes. Some readers might think that she settled for Clint and Matt when she finally gave up on John but they would be wrong. I loved how these guys are so passionate about Jambi and determined that she not only feel wooed, cherished, and not rushed. Bless their hearts, they really were trying to be gentlemen. It8217s clear from the get go, Jambi doesn8217t want gentle. However, she very much wants what these two guys bring separately and together to the relationship. Readers who don8217t enjoy a little M/M action need not read this book. These guys may be new to that arena but they catch on fast and hot!There8217s an underlying story that serves as the basis for Jambrea, Clint and Matt meeting up with someone who provides closure for Jambrea and John8217s history. It also sets up a future story for Ryan and Ben along with the tension generated between Lucas and Ellie. That8217s one story I have no doubt will have me crying big ugly tears. It8217s going to be so good when they find their HEA. They both deserve it so much!Spread Your Wings works fine as a stand-alone but there is a lot of history from the prior stories sprinkled in. I8217d forgotten that I8217d read the first book in the series when it came out a few years ago. I will most definitely be going back to read the missed in between books.

921915,B00K5ZBYAU,"[1, 1]",4,"I received my copy from the publisher through Love Romances and More:Cam is frustrated. His career as a porn star used to bring him satisfaction both physically and emotionally. These days though he just feels empty. Reduced to doing tame and unimaginative scenes with new recruits, Cam can8217t find the pleasure and satisfaction anymore. His boss, Jon Kellar, may provide him with an unexpected and not altogether comfortable form of release during their occasional sexual encounters, but there is no warmth, intimacy or connection to be found there. In fact, Jon comes with a dangerous and untrustworthy vibe.8220Porn used to be fun, a way of exploring his sexual identity and having a good time, but these days it seemed like a vise around his soul.8221Cam8217s frustration grows until he meets Sasha Tate and his BMX. Sasha is everything Cam has been yearning for, even if he wasn8217t aware of it. And handsome, sexy, charming and fun Sasha seems to be as attracted to Cam. They appear to be on a slow but steady path towards something more than friendship when Cam8217s chosen profession throws a spanner in the works and Sasha disappears.When Cam8217s world is further rocked by an unimaginable health shock he is close to hitting rock bottom. With everything he thought he was at stake he needs all the friendship, love and understanding he can get his hands on if he8217s to deal with all the s*** life is throwing at him.This is the second book I8217ve read by Garrett Leigh and let me tell you, this author does not believe in giving her characters an easy time. Cam had my heart broken on several occasions. The reader is almost eased into his pain. What at first appears to be 8216only8217 sexual frustration in the form of lots of release without intimacy, slowly turns into an awful lot more. Cam8217s loneliness, even while surrounded by people was difficult to read.8220He craved companionship and warmth but somehow, even though his night was sure to end connected to the body of another, he8217d never felt more alone.8221Garrett Leigh seems to know what she8217s writing about when it comes to suffering, medical battles and somehow surviving both. For the second time she managed to strike a chord with me, evoke feelings I8217ve been lucky enough to be able to leave behind me for a while now. The way she describes the pain and fear connected with a potentially fatal illness is almost too accurate for this reader. I had to walk away from this book once or twice. Not because the story didn8217t grip me 8211 it did. I had to create some distance was because the story hit too close to home.I loved the way Cam evolved as a character in this story. While it would have been easy to brush him off as almost shallow when the story starts, there is no way you could think of him in those terms when the story ends. His journey from a distinct but unidentifiable sense of dissatisfaction to realising what it was he8217d been looking for all along was spellbinding.8220Cam wanted to weep as he realized this was what he8217d been missing...searching for all along 8211 the undeniable sensation of shaking in a man8217s arms, of being held like he was that man8217s whole world.8221As I said above, this is the second book in a series. I didn8217t read the first book, although I now think I may have to in the not too distant future. While I never felt I missed out on vital information and think this book can easily be read and enjoyed on its own, I do believe I might have gotten more out of this book if I8217d read 8216Bullet8217 first.If I have one 8216complaint8217 about this book it is that it wasn8217t longer. Not that the story felt rushed or unfinished but I would have loved to spend some more time with Cam and Sasha.My final quote is only here because it holds so much meaning and I think it8217s a message people should take to hard before they8217ve reached that crucial and terrifying point.8220...but for me, confronting my mortality taught me to look beyond the obvious.8221","05 22, 2014",A2BWST7ZPUL3VE,Marleen,Beautiful,1400716800,1.0,True,4.0

I have to be honest, this is my first Dystopian read. I was not sure what to expect. I was very surprised of how well this story was written. The Characters, places, emotions, events are very well explained. It made me believe in this world.I did find the first couple of chapters overwhelming. There was a lot of information, which set a slow pace at the beginning of the story. I had a hard time connecting with the story in the beginning, but I found myself turning the pages much quicker after a couple of chapters.This story is unique and the author did a fantastic job in making us understand the meaning of FORGIVENESS. The love and hate relationship between the main characters was very well developed. They had to go through different kinds of emotions to end up where they did.I'm extremely happy that I stepped out of my comfort zone by reading Intermix Nation. It sure makes me want to read more books in this genre.

345151,B00A286OEQ,"[0, 0]",4,"Mandy's Review:Although short, UNLEASH THE CURSE tells a complete story like you would read in a standard sized novel. The reader is initially introduced to these characters in Ms. Egan's first book, DEMON'S CURSE. And, while you can read UNLEASH THE CURSE by itself, I think you would need to read DEMON'S CURSE first to get a real sense of who they are and the complexities of their relationships with each other.Sarah's low-bred social position prevents her from being with the one man she truly loves: Sebastian. Sebastian's problem is that he doesn't want to be tied down to just one woman. He has the same fears as many of us. That, after awhile, being with the same person over and over again, day in and day out, would become quite boring and repetitious. Upon seeing Sarah with another man, and possibly betrothed to him, causes Sebastian to realize his feelings for Sarah and his risk of being the society's talk of the town be damned.Sarah's problem of trying to figure a way out of her current marriage proposal tends to solve itself when her suitor turns out to be an evil, life-sucking, entity. As they battle him to the death, Sarah and Sebastian realize that, if they make it through this, they'll allow nothing to come between them ever again.So, like I said, a short read but a complete story. This novella serves as a segue between the first book, DEMON'S CURSE, and the second full-length novel, SHADOW'S CURSE. Oh, and just an FYI ... AWAKEN THE CURSE is a prequel to DEMON'S CURSE so you really want to read that one first.

If you have never read any of these authors or their books, this set is the perfect place to get introduced and at a great price. Can't beat $.99 for 6 books! I absolutely love Alexia Purdy's books. Great author! This was the first time that I've ever read Tara Maya but I was extremely pleased with her book. I have put her on my to read list because I would love to see where this story line is going to end up. LOVED Elle Casey's book to the point that i have already bought the next 3 in that series. Great concept that I haven't seen before and truly lovable (and hateable) characters. I have read a book similar in plot to JL Bryan's book but I will say that it was a good book.

Now this next one, well, I speak Geek pretty well and really didn't know if I was going to like Anthea Sharp's book but boy was I pleasantly surprised.

It is an excellent study of how flawed our police and judicial systems can be, not only in the United States but in other countries.  The writer takes us on a methodical look at how the crimes were committed, and how the felons were able to beat the system.  Many of the murderers mentioned in this book are now either dead or incarcerated for life, but it does point out that flaws do exist in our system of justice.  If you are interested in true life crime drama, this is definitely a must read!.","01 21, 2013",A3FK4XQ7YVVNQL,Linda Travers,A Must Read for Crime Buffs!,1358726400,0.6666666666666666,True,4.0

If so, check out Opening Act by Suleikha Snyder, a fun and realistic contemporary novella.Saroj Shah has been in love with Adam Harper since the day they met as freshman in college, about seven years ago. Unfortunately, Adam has never considered Saroj to be more than a good friend or sister, much to Saroj's dismay. Now they are both in the workforce, Saroj an entertainment reporter for the local paper and Adam, a restaurant manager.  Adam is also a hot bass player with a local grunge band.  Because of Saroj's feelings for Adam, she has been one of the band's groupies for years. Now she is required to hear them play because it is her job to cover them for the paper.Adam is basically clueless and has no idea that Saroj has feelings for him.  He is shocked when he finally finds out and needs a little time to regroup. Unfortunately, Saroj is tired of waiting. However, they are able to work through their issues and discover a possible future together.I liked this novella.  The writing is good, the characters are well-developed and the plot is heartfelt as well as realistic. Saroj is a bit whiny at times, but it is understandable because she has waited seven years for Adam to come around. Johnny, Adam's band-mate and best friend, is funny and a bit devious, which adds another dimension to this gem of a read.A gifted copy was provided by publisher for an honest review.","05 27, 2014",A2RNQXF81ALMK0,LJT,Great Book!,1401148800,0.0,False,5.0

566287,B00DMVZ4DM,"[0, 0]",4,"Wow. Losing Francesca is certainly something different! The description immediately grabbed my attention and I knew I had to read this one! Francesca is taken into custody by the FBI upon arriving to customs at the airport. Her face was recognized as a match to a progressive drawing of a girl who was kidnapped twelve years ago. What was suppose to be a fun summer before college becomes a legal battle before the judge pronounces her Fiona Sullivan and returns to her to the Sullivan farm. Now she's stuck there until Fiona turns 18, unless her father shows up proving otherwise. Francesca is determined to make life hell for her foster family, but she never expected Brody--the boy who looked for Fiona every day for 4 years and isn't about to let her go again.I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading Losing Francesca. It's not an action filled story by any means, but it is suspenseful in its own way. Nothing about Francesca's story added up. She was found with multiple passports, all with different names. She failed several polygraph tests regarding her identity. She has the same unusual silver eyes as the missing Fiona. She refuses to tell anybody her real name, where she's from, who her father is, or what he does. Even the vague memories she does share are reeking with suspicion. Who is Francesca really? During the weeks she spends with the Sullivans, even she starts to doubt what she knows about herself.While the focus is on Francesca's identity and the mystery of Fiona, there is a romance. It's not a sexed up romance that I'm sure we've all come to expect from New Adult, but it's still a great one! Brody was probably the most devastated when Fiona disappeared. They were just little kids and he believed she was his soulmate. Now that he thinks she's back, he's ready to convince her of this fact. Lucky for him, Francesca is not settling in too well, and he provides the listening ear and escape that she needs. Their relationship slowly builds and I totally believed them. I wanted Francesca to be Fiona for him! She ends up wanting that too, and who's to say that she's not.Losing Francesca goes out with a bang! I had formed my outrageous theory and was only partially correct. The whole truth was unexpected, but I'm glad it wasn't a complicated mess of shock after shock. It's pretty straight forward, but it's still a great conclusion to the question of where did Fiona Sullivan go and who is Francesca Sabatini.

His journey to find a way over the crevice that separates them is remarkable, well-thought out, and a wonderful mini-quest in this short. And, the creatures that come out of the crevice at night...they certainly amped up the tension.I thought the story felt like a cross between Steampunk and Post-Apocolyptic-Scy-Fy. It's pretty groovy, character driven, and filled with tension.I enjoyed the secondary characters almost as much as Abner. Junkyard is my kinda' dog - we should all be so lucky to have such a faithful companion. And as for Letch, well, he certainly left an impression on this reader.What bothered me. Well, there were issues with punctuation that sometimes threw me out of the story. I found some slips of point-of-view. Nothing that a fine-toothed edit couldn't fix, and certainly nothing that should keep readers away if they enjoy this genre.All-in-all I have to say I'd read more of these characters.","12 7, 2013",A24G76K4DBQX6D,The Author's Journal,I love a protagonist with a mission in mind.,1386374400,1.0,True,4.0

147470,B006J14KKK,"[4, 4]",2,"This is the story of Susan Carpenter ( aka Suzi Christmas), a 30 year old widow who, along with her six year old son, lives in the town of Holly Falls.  (I'm not sure where Holly Falls is supposed to be located, but it's somewhere in snow country).  Every Christmas Suzi pulls out all the stops when it comes to decorating.  Her house is lit up so bright it can be seen from space.  Every night she puts on a show, dressing as Mrs. Claus and handing candy out to the kiddies.When businessman Luke Potter loses a tenant due to Suzi's over-the-top Christmas display, he joins in a lawsuit seeking to pull the plug on Ms. Christmas.  But then Luke actually meets Suzi in person and he falls for her.  That's when things really get complicated.This book has `Lifetime Christmas Movie' written all over it.  The story is pretty silly, and nothing really adds up, but I can overlook much of that when reading a lighthearted Christmas romance.  After all, it's the spirit of the season that we're trying to evoke, and if you're going to indulge in some empty calories you might as well do it at Christmas.  And things started off OK, or at least not too bad.  But then something began to grate on my nerves.  Never, in any part of this book does anyone tell Suzi that maybe just maybe, she's taking this too far.  Nope, everyone walks on eggshells around Suzi and she's never encouraged to see the other person's point of view. Compromise?  No way.  Suzi just knows that the True Meaning of Christmas can only be found in a blinding array of lights, blaring music and live actors staging a manger scene on your front lawn night after night.  Anyone who disagrees is labeled a Scrooge.  Suzi really does come off as a self-absorbed, immature girl/woman who is determined to have her own way.  By the end of the book (and she spends at least the last 50 pages in tears), I wanted to tie the annoying woman to a chair (with garland, of course!) and force her to listen to Jingle Bell Rock at full blast until she came to her senses.Whew, it feels good to get that off my chest!  I know this is supposed to be just a bit of feel good Christmas fluff, but I dislike narrow minded characters and I absolutely hate it when someone is vilified and forced to grovel for no good reason.  Poor Luke, humiliated and ostracized all for the terrible crime of not wanting someone else to force their idea of Christmas's True Meaning down his throat.  Hey Suzi, I know what you can do with that candy cane!Obviously, I'm not recommending this to anyone.  If you insist though...there is no strong language or sexual content.  According to a note the author wrote in the preface for the kindle version, this is a story she wrote many years ago.  Believe me, it shows.  There are attempts to insert some modern things like cellphones and ipads, but overall it does feel like the story takes place in the late 1980's or early 1990's.  While some things improve with age (like wine), others are best left in the past (like polyester bell bottoms).  Give this one a pass.","01 2, 2013",A1XCSAX4BRT89Y,L.

Walker delved into the dark places of human emotion and found a wonderful cautionary tale that resonates with me still.Cherise is the quintessential wallflower. At the prompting of a friend, she attends a frat party that starts off like a dream come true but descends into a nightmare. Cherise emerges from that night scarred in ways that color everything she does. She finds solace and help in an unlikely source. Enter Jonathan who in many ways is as scarred as Cherise is.Can they navigate the choppy waters and the chasms of memory to excise a demon driven deep or will the cruelty of one act destroy all they hope to build?I'm not one to give spoilers.

Jacqueline has long since put her fantasy away, believing no man could ever fulfill it for her.  That is, until a wicked Halloween night with the young attorney she's mentoring leads her to voice her desires.  What Jacqueline doesn't expect is that the attorney in question, Ryan, wants nothing more than to give Jacqueline exactly what she wants.  Yet, soon after Jacqueline and Ryan embark on their erotic adventure, both find it hard to keep pretending at the office that there is nothing between them.  Ryan wants a real relationship, but Jacqueline believes they are too different  from one another to have something permanent.  Will Ryan be able to convince Jacqueline he's perfect for her as himself, rather than just as the man in the black leather mask?It's an undeniable fact that Evangeline Anderson knows how to make you sweat.  With The Man in the Black Leather Mask, Ms. Anderson has once again cranked up the heat to scorching and I couldn't be happier.

Jacqueline is a woman who's been burned by love in a number of ways.  It's hard for her to trust a man with her heart and it's even harder when the man she finds herself falling for is a gorgeous hunk ten years younger than she.  While her uncertainty is understandable, I looked forward to Ryan making her see that he is perfect for her, just as he is.  And how could you not love Ryan?  He's the kind of man who goes all-out for the woman he loves, carrying out her fantasy and proving that his feelings for her are the real thing.

You'll be delighted to meet the character who proudly declares By the age of ten I had awakened myself from a dead sleep with laughter so often...that my mother took me to a psychologist...Fortunately you can read this delightful adventure by daylight or lamplight, unlike the magical Book of Dreams that holds the bones of the main story and can only be read by starlight.  Marlowe is a first rate storyteller who intertwines adventure and fantasy with thought provoking revelations. Sprinkled judiciously throughout the book are brief supporting stories which will equally delight and enlighten.While Sleepwalker: The Last Sandman sits comfortably in the same niche as the works of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, Marlowe holds true to his own unique creative vision. I think you'll agree with me that Marlowe delivers  ...a happy ending that gives me exactly what I want, but in a way that I never expected. And that's a promise.","10 29, 2009",A55VQ3KUD630L,Old Granny Granny,"Gives me exactly what I want, in a way I never expected",1256774400,0.0,False,5.0

Even without knowing it8217s what her father would have expected she needs to go and pay her respects to a man who gave her comfort when she needed it most.After the funeral she wants to go home to Katie as quickly as possible but finds herself drawn back to the house at the request of the widow. Soon she if presented with a cold case file and the suggestion that Captain Wise8217s death was not an accident.  Rainey is willing to take a look and use her behavioral analyst8217s skills, but then she wants out 8211 back to the child-free Valentine8217s Day weekend she has planned.But as usual things never go smoothly when Rainey Blue Bell gets involved with a serial killer 8211 even if the case is Colde.-------------This is the fourth Rainy Bell series. It stands alone, but will be much better appreciated as part of the series.Here RE Bradshaw takes Rainey and Katie down a slightly different track. Still a page turning thriller with a serial killer on the lose, this novel is gentler, more about the thought and analysis of a murder than the stark drama of the previous sadistic attacks on Rainey and Katie. Without giving any spoilers when Rainey8217s life if threatened the sense is less whether she will survive and more how.As always Ms Bradshaw8217s books are extremely well crafted and edited. The words flow, the characterization is brilliant and the dialogue both realistic and clever. It is the wit and elegance of the interactions that make these books stand out. As we have come to know Rainey and Katie the love and humor between them grows. Their adoration is palpable, their comfort together radiates, and their knowledge of each other leads to a tolerant and amused interaction. As additional pleasure we meet Danny again and have Molly and Leslie visit, a combination of friends that brings out the softer side of Rainey.It is this softer side Me Bradshaw explores. How Rainey8217s thought process works is as much a part of this story as how the cold genius of the serial killer has managed to get away with the clever crimes. We watch Rainey use her mind to analyze the events from the past and survive the threats of the present. As much as anything though it is her love for her family that shines through, and although she doesn8217t spend much time at home in this tale, the family is a constant presence and ultimately her driving force.RE Bradshaw creates wonderful people and intriguing plots. Rainey and Katie are two of the most loveable couples in print. It is always a joy to revisit old friends and this will not disappoint. Definitely another 5 star read and a great addition to the Rainey Bell family saga.","05 9, 2014",A3DSB2ATHNOMQH,VelvetLounger VelvetLounger,Another great Rainey Bell thriller,1399593600,1.0,True,5.0

Cooking is something personal and I really like it when the writer shares what they like about the recipe. Chef Ban does a great job of educating the reader on the history of the food (personal and cultural) as well as the health benefits of the ingredients/dish.2) The book is illustrated with pictures. Granted, the pictures are hard to see on my kindle touch but most self published cook books are just words after words.3) All the recipes include a yield and cooking time. I know it sounds minor but a lot of self published cook book authors forget these valuable information.Now some of the opportunities... Well no, not opportunities but rather a heads up...1) This is not a book full of curry recipes. A lot of the dishes in here will probably be unfamiliar to most people (they were to me). For example, the first few dishes in the book are chicken and broad beans gravy, multi-flavored raw mango dip, hot tomato and pepper water, and beef mince gravy.2) All the measurements (with the exception of teaspoon and tablespoon) are in grams. I have been cooking for a long time but I will admit that I have no idea what 100 gram of chopped tomato looks like.3) Some of the words and names are not colloquial. For example, refined oil... not sure what that is... Splutter?4) Unless you live in an area with an Indian grocery store some of the ingredients are going to be impossible to find off line.

It was unfair, but as was pointed out, they needed a scapegoat.Now, despite the story line, I felt there was too much of a push for the romance/erotica of the relationship between Val and Nate. Like, way too much. Too overdone, to over the top, given that there was little character development of either of them in this novel. Carr has used the story line as a smokescreen for the blatant erotica she dumped in this book. I was caught very off guard by the amount. Yes, the first few episodes were perfectly placed, but then it seemed as if that8217s all the book was about, with Val trying to push Nate away with her own issues with casual sex. Every time I flipped a page, Val was throwing up an excuse as to why she and Nate could not be together8230and then she8217d end up in a steamy session with him right after the words left her lips!

Blake, an experienced Dominant has identified nurse, Megan, as his potential BDSM submissive and invites her to train as such and explore any sexual kink with him as her Master. Megan, whose sexual confidence has been damaged from her ex-husband, has limited sexual experience and has no real understanding of the role of a sexual submissive or anything to do with BDSM lifestyles. Her initial reactions to Blake's proposition are realistic and well thought out.

I am just sitting here with my mouth hanging wide open trying to take it all in and figure it all out.Jane has been hurt in her past and she wants to wallow in self-pitty on this one day each year. Remember that as the day everything changed in her life. But instead of letting her wallow, her friends decided it was girls night out8230 And girls night out was going well until an old friend introduced her to someone new8230 Brady.What I loved about this book is that all of the characters were normal, yes, even though there were two or four professional baseball players in the book, every one of them acted completely genuine. I liked the honesty between friends, even if it is filthy. The crazy banter between friends is comical and reassuring. It is a reminder for those of us that are always lost in books that the little things can be funny. These friends are the kind of foul-mouthed, no brain-mouth filtered friends you want in your life, especially if you have no family to fall back on.I loved the story, but within Jane and Brady8217s romace brewing, I loved the side relationship with Jane8217s best friend and her man, Luke. Though this portion of the story line ended up causing me great grief and annoyance, I loved these two. I think they may be rabbits though because when the are together, they don8217t come up for air often. I also developed a soft spot for Michael, however, there was one point in the book that I could have popped him in the face8230 but alas, he is still the ultimate friend. Risking his heart for an amazing friendship.So there were some spots in the book with name confusion in the book, meaning the wrong names were used in certain areas of the book. Was it the worst thing that could have happened? Absoulutely not. Because the stroy pushed it and made it easy to keep up even when you knew that the wrong name was being used.All in all, i adored this book.

Mitchell for awhile so I was excited for the fourth book in the Bad in Baltimore series called BAD INFLUENCE. However, upon starting, I felt something different about this book. At first, I wondered if it was because I wasn8217t in a good reading mojo. The week had been a brutal one and had sapped a lot of my emotions out already, but for some reason, I still couldn8217t find myself connecting to a lot of the characters in this book.Jordan Barnett told his parents he was gay. Instead of accepting it, his parents threw him out and put him in a conversion camp where they hoped they could remove him of his sins. Jordan then went to see someone he trusted to help him out of the situation, but was turned down. Despite his broken heart, Jordan didn8217t give up but transformed into Silver, a street-savvy man who became a prostitute.I really liked Silver. I thought he was the one character in this book that had different dimensions, wasn8217t overly annoying and had a strong presence. However, the rest of the characters seemed to annoy me most of the time as I read. Mitchell places a lot of emphasis on past characters in the series. While I think it8217s nice to have the tie in, it also creates for a lot of drama, especially when you include individual as well as couple issues. The story becomes too convoluted with everything that is going on.Because of that, I also feel that Zeb8217s character wasn8217t really formed fully. He didn8217t stand out very much and I still don8217t know why. I just never really connected with him at all and found his character to be forgettable. As a result, it made it hard for me to believe in the romance.So while BAD INFLUENCE didn8217t resonate with me as much as I had hoped it would, it8217s still a great read if you enjoy angst in your books.*ARC provided by publisher","04 25, 2014",A1JKGTL51HHTU1,Under The Covers Book Blog,it's okay.,1398384000,1.0,True,3.0

This book has zero character development and a repetitive plot that shows little imagination except concerning ways to kill.

Having just flown in from the USA where he has been working, he8217s eager to spend some time with Kate as, unbeknownst to her, he8217s always had a soft spot for his sister8217s best friend.Kate soon realises that she couldn8217t have asked for a better partner to attend the reunion with her.  He is attentive, funny and shares all kinds of memories from their teenage years with their former peers.  And their first kiss 8230 it8217s earth shattering.However their new found friendship appears about to blow up in their faces when they can8217t keep their lips off one another and rather embarrassingly get caught in the lift, after which she remembers that she was meant to tell her mother about the surprise that she had for her.When Kate8217s ex-fianceacute arrives in Australia and Josh makes some startling revelations and an unexpected proposal, we see Kate floundering and can only hope that she will realise that not even she can plan love.I first met Kate Adams in Imelda Evans8217 debut novel, Rules are for Breaking (my review here) which tells the story about the 8220three strikes and you8217re out8221 Jo Marchant and how she met Declan.  I was therefore thrilled when Imelda contacted me and requested a review on Playing by the Rules and immediately sank my teeth into it.Imelda's characters are well-crafted and Kate, who is seriously flawed, managed to annoy me intensely with her constant planning for everything in her life.  Josh, on the other hand, is the total opposite, being almost flawless and just so darned nice and there were a few times in the novel where I really felt sorry for him and wanted to shake some common sense into Kate with all her little insecurities.

356474,B00A9YWQQ8,"[4, 4]",5,"`Blood Type Weight Loss' is a great new book that explains how to lose weight by eating the right foods depending on your blood type.  The science behind this explains that every blood type has sensitivities to certain foods and that by changing what you eat to correspond with your blood type.  It's not a new theory, but it is one that hasn't seen a lot of coverage in the media lately.  This is the perfect beginner book for anyone looking to lose weight with this method.Williams treads carefully with this book, since he is not a doctor he can't write like he is one.  But he does relay some great tips and advice that has been gathered to provide readers with an easy to access weight loss guide.  The diet itself isn't hard to follow, and there are tons of information online that goes into much more detail on the science and the history of the weight loss method.  This book simply gathers the basics together in one neat location for quick reference.It is packed with tips on what to eat for each blood type and offers a fresh look at this particular method of weight loss.  Some of the tips are about the diet itself, and others are about combining the diet with activity to increase the weight loss and improve fitness.  The great thing about this diet is how good you will feel once you are eating right for your blood type.  The author mentions this when he talks about the increased energy levels and overall sense of feeling great.  Your self-esteem will skyrocket once you get your weight where you want it to be, and this book helps you achieve that without a struggle or starvation.As someone who has tried a lot of diets I know that not all diets are the real deal.  This is one that I have actually had some success with, and more importantly it was one that I found easy to maintain.  I felt better than I had in a long time while on this diet.  My energy levels have been up and I already notice that my clothes fit better after just a few weeks.  The best thing about this book is the fact that it is easy to follow and I don't feel like it's a struggle to maintain, unlike some other books and diets I have tried.  This is actually more of a life change than a diet or quick fix, although the results are coming pretty quickly for me.If you are looking for an easy to follow diet plan that actually works, this is a must read book.  You will be so glad that you read it once you start losing the weight!","12 4, 2012",A3VNEBY6WDE4QY,Woodsusa,Best diet advice for all blood types,1354579200,1.0,True,5.0

If you would like to check out my review of the first book, Gateway, click here.In this second book, we see that Ember actually has a little more confidence in herself and is a vital part to the Institute in Los Angeles , even if the Elders don't like it.I like the fact that our main heroine, Ember, has a lot more going on.  She isn't the broken fragile girl we meet in the first book, but more sure of herself.  This is not to say she still doesn't fear the demons hell, I don't blame her for still being afraid of something that can take over her mind and freewill like it did.  Ember has grown a lot but we can still glimpse that scared little girl too.  To me, this makes her more realistic and a lot more likable character.Speaking of characters, I love all the supporting ones in this story, good and bad.  The antagonists are true evil and yet...you can't help but enjoy their view on the world.  We have a lot of different types of demons that are explained in this story and it always brings to mind, Supernatural.  (I know, I know...I tend to compare books to T.V. shows.  Don't judge me.)Alexander is a mystery, even though I found myself questioning his motives the entire time.  He is a charismatic man and you can see potential through his eyes.Taren is a great YA boyfriend.  He is your typical strong, loyal, protective and gorgeous male lead.  I think he is good for Ember, especially being the one that found her in the first book.Ms. Garner does know how to write a steamy sexy scene for YA eyes, just enough ummph to make you sweat, yet it doesn't cross the line into no man's land.The main plot is basically the same as in the first book and at first I thought this would get a little boring but instead Ms. Garner inserted different twists into the book that made it even more exciting.  I did feel like some minor plot lines were left unsettled, especially having to do with the marks fading.I was at times, wanting to scream at Ember to think actually think about what was happening!  But even through this, I still felt this strong connection with Ember and I like her as our female lead.But my most favorite character in this book?  Kat! This girl totally rocks! She is funny, smart, sexy, a kick ass Guardian, and yes...she is snarky!(My coveted word for those I truly treasure)Oh and of course there is a cliffhanger that will have you pulling your hair out by the roots but I completely understand why it had to happen...but still.There is a lot of grammatical errors in this story though.  I usually try to look past these but there was a few times I got a little distracted by these mistakes.  Thankfully, though, the plot is strong enough to keep my interest in this story.I can't wait till book three when we get to meet Cole, in person, and I have a feeling he will play a major part (and perhaps love interest for one of Ember's shy friends?) in the finality of the Gateways.  I just hope he and Taren will get along...Update: I did find out from the author that the copy I received was more of ARC copy but the final copy that is available for purchase and download is free of these errors.

She is a fun author. Her characters always have great chemistry and she is a great storyteller. Even the One Hot Scott is no exception. Although it's a novella and only 50 pages the story is still enjoyable, although short.In 50 pages she gives us a heroine and hero with a villain to add intrigue to the story. Julia Prentiss is our heroine. She is trying to escape on horseback when she falls and is in the middle of the highlands. Luckily, she is found by Duncan Lenox. He is swimming naked when Julia sees him. They have instant chemistry. Julia is hesitant to explain to Duncan why she is running away. Duncan offers her protection in a cabin nearby. At first she refuses but she is left with little choice since there is a storm coming, she is lost and has no horse to ride away.While in the cabin Duncan and Julia get to know each other. She learns that he takes care of his sisters and he learns why she escaped. (I'll leave it to the readers to find out what had Julia riding on horseback in the middle of the highlands.) Julia is from London but in Scotland on holiday with her sister and mom when she runs into some trouble.The bad guys, Bellamy and Orville, come after Julia but Duncan is able to protect her. He offers to marry her so she can be protected from them. Since this is a novella, she accepts and stays in his home in Scotland.

787158,B00HSYBRIU,"[0, 0]",4,"SUMMARYThe concept of the book is a choose-your-own-adventure. The reader has the option of making the decisions for the main character, and as a result, the story can change depending on the reader's choices.We follow a woman, Bebe McFerrin, who works at a law firm but is terrible pushover. When a colleague steals her case (and her promotion), Bebe wishes aloud that she could take revenge without any consequences. She is then surprised to discover that a demon has overheard her wish, and is willing to give her all that she desires, in exchange for some small favors...From there, the reader takes over the main character's choices, allowing the story to unfold. Sometimes menacing, sometimes hilarious, this story is wonderful however, while concept-wise it is intriguing, it is somewhat problematic in its execution, as we will detail below.THE GOOD...1) Childhood is callingRemember those old pick your own adventure stories? The ones during childhood, when you could pick up a book and flip through it, making the character's decisions and seeing what resulted? Well, be prepared to have nostalgic flashbacks, because this book is a choose-your-own-adventure story. Only this time it's updated into .mobi format, so that rather than having to flip through the pages manually you can click the choices inside the document, making for a much smoother transition. It's like an old-fashioned form of video game, except with reading involved.2) You can lose at the endAt the end of the book, if the choices are made in a certain way, it's entirely possible for the demon involved to steal the main character's soul. This means that, like a video game, there is a way for the reader to lose. Because there are several endings, it is also possible for the reader to think that he's won, only to discover the opposite. We thought this was awesome, because many authors are too timid to go there. For a book like this, however, not going all the way could end up being a disaster, because the reader wants options. By giving us the option to fail, and condemn Our Heroine to destruction, it makes the reading more worthwhile for us.3) CharacterizationThese characters are all excellently done, from the villain to the protagonist to the extras. There is howling hilarity and deadly earnestness in them all. Even though the demon is the equivalent of a used car salesman, he still is likeable in the I love to hate you sort of way. As for the protagonist, we also liked how she was a pushover. No joke! This is rather meta, but it makes sense: the reader is making decisions for someone who can't decide for herself. We're not sure if this irony was intentional or not, but it makes sense so we're going to just go with it. And yes, even though she wasn't able to stick up for herself, we still found ourself just liking her. Bebe McFerrin may be a bit of a twit, but she also has a kind heart to her. Perhaps a little too kind, but that's part of her charm.4) WritingAs the above demonstrates, this book is has excellent writing. There are little to no spelling, grammar, or even formatting errors. It reads easily and concisely, while still providing ample amounts of information and description for our imaginations to crunch on. The humor in particular is wonderful. There are times when this book can be sad, but it almost always has some kind of witty comeback that will make things all right again.THE BAD...1) Problematic execution: All roads lead to RomeInstead of having many potential narratives, this book follows just one narrative: there is really only one concrete plot. Although there might be small differences in that plot based on the reader's choices, ultimately it is an all roads lead to Rome situation, where no matter what the choices made, the character is going to end up in the same destination. What this essentially means is, this book is more like an actual novel than a choose-your-own-adventure story. Going through the book for the first time, it is every bit as engaging as you'd expect a choose-your-own-adventure to be. The writing, the characterization, the pacing, and the humor all make it a very fun ride. Personally, if this were an ordinary novel, we'd rate it highly based on the fun we had just reading it. But the problem is that when it comes to the options, there is no real way to escape the main narrative of the story, which means that after the first read-through it becomes less entertaining.It is definitely worth noting, however, that there is differentiation during the end of the story. Depending on the reader's choices throughout the story, Our Heroine can secure her freedom or suffer the consequences of her evil actions. Because of this, there is some importance attached to the character's actions throughout the story all our choices ultimately aren't for naught, because they will have an effect at the end. But those actions just happen to be ones that won't affect the plot, because the plot is unchangeable. For this reason, we don't think that one could read this book more than two or three times, which is a shame, given that theoretically a choose-your-own-adventure could be read many times over with different results each time.THE BIZARRE...1) Reluctance to swearWhen a woman is being nasty, she's a birch. As in the tree. There are other cases of swearing and cursing being replaced with inventive sound-a-like words.Hey, we can identify! On this blog, we've called characters bass turds. As in, fish poop.We found these attempts to allude to swearing to be humorous. We can see that they might work to make this book a little more kid-friendly, which given its style (again, it's choose-your-own-adventure) is probably beneficial for its audience.2) Real-life prizesThere are occasions in here where the author will give people who have made certain choices real-life prizes, usually in the case of free samples from other books. We thought this was a really interesting way to bring the real world into the book, and give extra kudos for it. We think it's really interesting how this book can be interacted with on a number of levels, with the characters interacting together, the reader choosing for the protagonist, and the author interacting with the reader....AND THE VERDICT:This book is BIZARRE.Novel-wise, it's excellent. Choose-your-own-adventure-wise, it could be better. Given the abilities that this author has shown-both in this book's writing, and in his ability to market the book-we actually expect VERY big things from him in the future. In reading through the book for the first time, we were happy with it however, each subsequent re-read was less enjoyable because we discovered that there was a lack in plot variation. Now, don't get us wrong-for what it is, the book is actually quite fun. But compared to what it could be, to what this author could obviously make it be, it doesn't measure up. We can only imagine what this author could do if he worked on a similar project and threw even more effort into it. For that reason we are going to watch him very closely in the future, and greatly look forward to his next project.","04 23, 2014",A3LFEKSKMU4S0C,GoodBadBizarre,Lesson learned: don't trust demons,1398211200,0.0,False,4.0

They met when she was 16, Julian was on his way to becoming a wastrel but when he stopped to visit his cousin Barbara in Bath he had a wonderful time and he found that he was becoming fond of her friend Philippa. But Julian knew she was too young. He was holding her hand just before leaving Bath when her father saw them and immediately became angry.Julian has dedicated himself to changing so that he will be worthy of Philippa, They plan to meet again in London where he will conduct a respectable courtship for her hand - what could go wrong?Delightful and charming, this is a sweet romance that can be read in one session. I loved Philippa a very dutiful daughter who only wants to be happy.This was definitely not one of Ms. Balogh's usual books but it was definitely worth the price and was held to her usual high standards.

This is only part of the whole story and should be read with the understanding that you need to have read what came before and the rest is still to come.Once again Lee Brazil delivers a wonderful addition to the Pulp Friction series. The story continues and we get to see more growth from both Finn and Cannon as individuals. Finn is realizing that maybe the Prince Charming theme isn8217t working for him and Cannon is starting to gain confidence and go after what he wants. The back and forth between the men continues but it just makes me want them to get together even more. I would have liked a little more progress and interaction between Finn and Cannon, besides just sex. But even with that minor issue, I am still so addicted to this series.I love the little bit of crossover with whispering winds storyline with Rowe and Mick.

526860,B00CUEGU4E,"[0, 0]",3,"Sheila Connolly who usually writes the Orchard Mystery and A Museum Mystery series has branched out with what looks like a standalone novel. This novel revolves around Abby Kimball trying to discover why she is seeing people who have been dead for centuries. A chance visit to a historical home triggers an episode and they just keep coming. Fortunately she has kindly history buff Ned to help her.Abby is in a fairly unsatisfactory relationship as her fianceacute pays very little attention to her and seems to only value her cooking and cleaning skills. She recognises this but does little to change the situation until towards the end. Watching the relationship disintegrate was not pleasant and I wanted her to show some gumption a bit earlier.The biggest strength of this novel is the history and the genealogical research. I have been researching my family history for about 15 years so I enjoyed reading about Abby uncovering her past. The problem was that it focussed more on the genealogy rather than fleshing it out with family history - we got the tree if you like but were missing many of the leaves. Just as people's eyes tend to glaze over when I recite baptism, marriage and death dates without providing the context, I found it difficult to connect with these people. I think a pedigree chart would have been very helpful in keeping the ancestors straight and showing the lineage. Also, if a family has been established in an area for a while they tend to show up in newspapers, court records etc but Abby ignored this. I wish Abby could have unearthed a diary or connected what she was seeing with real life.The pacing was awkward as it veered from a distinct relationship section to a research section and back again. There is no real climax in either the relationship or the research as the end results were heavily foreshadowed. The novel ended fairly abruptly which was a shame as we get some genuinely interesting information provided at the end.Relatively Dead suffers from a lack of focus and this affected my enjoyment. The genealogical section is sound though and if that sort of thing interests you then you might enjoy it more.*book received from publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*","06 24, 2013",AD02QB8MGJOH2,Vilia,Genealogical mystery,1372032000,0.0,False,3.0

The twins are convinced that Kate has been sent to hunt them down for her husband, but she really has no idea what's going on. They tell their story, which of course, causes Kate to want to help them. She knows how hard it is to be separated from the person you love most in the world, and is willing to challenge Zeus and Henry to let them be together. I really just love how Kate stands up to the council, and is willing to fight for change and what she believes is right. The gods are too dead set in their ways and let their pride rule them, but Kate is slowly but surely worming her way under their skin.I don't think The Goddess Hunt is a required read for the series. It's just a short interlude of part of Kate's time away from Eden. It's barely even referenced in the next book. However, if you are a fan of mythology retellings (which I assume you are if you're interested in this series), then this is probably worth a read.

Months later, he and his men attack the castle of Noelle Sinclair's father in Durham (northeast England today) and he claims the tawny haired beauty as his, no matter she's English.The story of a Viking capturing an English maiden works for me every time, and Rand did it well. She is obviously a superb storyteller and I'll read more of hers. The chemistry between the two and the sexy way Randvior feels about Noelle was very well done. The beginning was a bit of a scramble as I tried to picture all that was going on (the castle being attacked and Nicole's brother betraying her), but once I got past that, the story flowed smoothly and kept me turning pages. It's a tale of conquest, treachery and betrayal as Randvior tries to do what is right in the face of so much wrong, and Nicole attempts to adapt to Viking ways for the man she loves.There were a few things that detracted from an otherwise 5-star story. To me, historical details are important, but others might not care:--Modern phrasing and words (live with it, just a pretty face, zigzag, nerve ending, bodyguard, honeymoon, climatic, bookshelf, etc.)--I understand the author did this on purpose, but it stopped me every time.--The castle (most of the castles in England, including Durham castle, were built by the Normans who came with William I in 1066, and did not exist at this time. French kings built castles (to keep out the marauding Norse), but the first recorded motte castle in England was in 1051 when French castle builders constructed one for the English king in Hereford.)--The reference to Nicole being Saxon (the Saxons were in the south in Wessex and Durham is in the northeast, or Northumbria, where the Angles lived--we now think of them collectively as Anglo-Saxon but at the time they were separate).--The mention of wine in bottles with labels (until the 17th century, glass was too fragile to use for storing or transporting wines they used wooden casks for the most part and clay jars and other pottery containers for serving).--The mention of books: bound books as we know them today, the kind you carry around, weren't available in the early 11th century. Although the codex had replaced the scroll, and monasteries preserved the scripture on parchment, books were large and had to be hand copied (the printing press came centuries later).--The use of surnames (i.e., Nicole Sinclair). In Britain, surnames weren't adopted until the 13th century. I understand the author did this intentionally, but it did throw me when I first saw it. Also, if Nicole's father was Lord Sinclair, she would not have his title as her surname (assuming they had surnames).","09 9, 2013",A3LEH416AV3VTU,Regan,4 and 1/2 Stars - Absorbing Viking Tale!,1378684800,1.0,True,4.0

Zeth has opened Sloane's mind to new ways of thinking and my oh my does she reap the benefits of such enlightenment.This book truly felt like a movie to me, it was fast paced, had heart stopping moments and also enlightened us with more about Zeth's feelings which he struggles to communicate to Sloane. With his pov as a reader you can feel what he's reluctant to admit to Sloane as he's surprised to admit it to himself.Everyone has upped their game in luring Sloane and Zeth into games they don't want to play.

You either are impressed by someone or completely turned off.Even more insufferable are those occasions when you are a guest at a wedding - a solo guest. You know that plus one on the invitation? Isn't it far more comforting and satisfying to pen in the name of your plus one than it is to leave it blank?Sophie agrees. When invited to her cousin's wedding, Sophie dreads returning home single, without a plus one. So she checks the box and hopes for the best. With just a few days to go, however, Sophie realizes she either needs a miracle or needs to not show up.Fortunately, the former obliges in the comely form of Adam, a coworker who also happens to be quite the heartbreaker.Adam agrees to accompany Sophie not out of any great kinship or kindness but rather because he's guilted into it by a mutual friend of theirs. He hardly knows Sophie, and even though it turns out that the low key look she sports at work does not reflect the gorgeous woman she is, Adam nonetheless is a little nervous. The more time he spends with her, the more he likes her. The same goes for Sophie, who's heard the rumors about Adam. But he's nice to her, he plays the game in front of her friends and family, and on those occasions he has to kiss her? Those are quite, quite nice.Adam and Sophie are far more alike than they would care to admit. Both of them are focused on work, both move about life avoiding romantic entanglements, and both protect their hearts. Which means they clearly are made for each other.You can tell that this is one of those Cute Romance Novels, can't you? It's all cute, from Sophie to Adam to their families and friends. They're both so darn likable that you almost need an insulin shot. In fact, that's perhaps my biggest complaint: I needed a little something to cut the sugar, and by a little something, I mean a hot sex scene.For a while there, it looks like you're going to get one. Or more. But just as the action heats up, there is either coitus interruptus or the curtain comes down.Still, for all its predictability and cuteness overload, it's a fun, quick read.Just don't expect anything hot.Thanks to NetGalley for the previewPublished on cupcake's book cupboard@VivaAmaRisata","09 2, 2013",A2DER7R7N0DL3C,vox libris,3.5 for cuteness overload ... but in need of some heat,1378080000,0.6666666666666666,True,3.0000000000000004

I was right. Since I'm also a giant pet lover with three dogs and two cats of my own, a pet psychic set off the goodwill radar. And, the down on his luck, life has beaten him down guy paired with young, bubbly, and sweet did me in the rest of the way. This book is, in fact, two short stories combined so I felt that I was getting two for the price of one.I fell in love with Leander (Andy) about two seconds into this read. Anyone who says, very offhand, that they don't have any friends, and they seem completely okay with that fact, has me at hello. And the more I read, the harder I fell. I mean, who doesn't like a guy who watches football to root for the underdogs and cheers on guys who don't even have the ball? I tell you, halfway through this book, I just wanted to take Andy home. He is a psychic who finds things, anything that has been lost, pets, keys, cars, people, etc. He also works as a paid audience member on TV shows to fill up seats. Yeah, I know, I thought that was adorable, too. Andy's parents died when he was young, he was raised by his grandma, he reads a lot, and loves herbal teas.Jon is a cynic. An absolute grump. Granted, after what he's been through, it's perfectly understandable. He used to work construction, but an accident that killed his wife and messed up his shoulder left him depressed with nightmares and sleepwalking. He is completely gay, but explaining the marriage and wife would be a spoiler, so you'll have to read the book. Taking a chance, he's going back to school, although his initial thoughts of automotive maintenance or electrical were thrown to the wayside when his advisor saw his drawing skills. Now he's majoring in art with an idea to work in advertisement design.In the first case, when Andy impresses an officer by spot-on describing where a body can be found, the officer lets his uncle, a homicide detective, know. The detective comes a'calling to see if Andy can help identify a woman murdered almost twenty years ago that is a cold case but still bothers the detective that she could never be identified. Unfortunately, there's not much for Andy to go on as the woman was found naked in a motel room with no personal items. Hmm. In the second case, the mystery comes along a lot more insidiously. Jon and Andy run into an old acquaintance of Jon's and his partner while out wandering the neighborhood after a horrible windstorm. In an incredibly roundabout way, Jon and Andy manage to solve a crime that hadn't even been reported, but lost some acquaintances in the process.This was my first foray into a Lou Harper book, but I can guarantee it won't be the last. I loved the writing, the characters were solid and strong, it sort of reminded me of an old detective dime store novel except with gay men, and the mystery stories were excellent.

804498,B00I1TLSN0,"[1, 1]",4,"Dark and gritty is the best way to describe this book. While this book is fiction, it's based on actual events. I live in a small town in northern Michigan, so the environment in which Noel and Terrell grow up is quite foreign to me. It's both terrifying and heartbreaking to know that some children really do grow up like these characters do, surrounded by drugs and guns and crime and murder. When my son turned 18, I bought him an iPhone. Terrell's mother gives her son a wallet, $5,000, and a gun. And a hooker.The chapters alternate narration between Noel and Terrell, and each chapter is headed by a line from later in the chapter designed to draw the reader in and make him/her keep reading. It worked if I read the heading, I had to keep reading  because I was curious about the context of the heading sentence. It would have been helpful if the chapters been headed with the name of the narrating character. If I stopped reading at the end of a chapter and went back to the book later, I couldn't always immediately remember which character it was speaking when I picked the book back up.The grammar was rough in places, but this is one of those rare cases where I (mostly) didn't mind, because it fit the tone and style of the book. The story is told in a first person POV, so the language of both the narration and the dialogue has an urban slang feel to it. There's also one spot where a character is mentioned as if the reader should already know who she is, and then is introduced later in the chapter, which was a little disconcerting.That aside, Blinded Thoughts is one of those books that stays in your mind long after you've finished reading it. I was really drawn into these young men's lives. Much like real life, the ending isn't wrapped up and tied off with a pretty little bow, and there isn't a happily ever after. This is not a book for the faint of heart. If it were a movie, it would be rated R. There's swearing, drug use, child abuse, guns, violent crimes up to and including murder, and some sexual situations. This is not an easy book to read, content-wise. (In terms of writing style, however, I flew through it in less than a day).  It is, however, a sad and tragic tale of how people's environments affect not just the choices they make (and the consequences of those choices), but also how it shapes the people they grow up to become.","07 17, 2014",A29NNYBMVN3DDB,Tara Carlson,Dark and Gritty,1405555200,1.0,True,4.0

741938,B00H0V069M,"[0, 0]",5,"Play is the second book to the Stage Dive series from Kylie Scott and it definitely was one book that kept me from sleeping.  I think I8217m still recovering from staying up two nights in a row to finish this book.  If I didn8217t have prior commitments I probably would8217ve finished this book in one night, but unfortunately I didn8217t want to be a zombie the next morning.  (This mama has to chase after a toddler during the day) Once I started reading Play, I had a hard time putting down my dang Kindle.  One reason was because I fell head over heels for Malcolm (aka Mal8230the sexy drummer to Stage Dive).  Ever had that one character that captured your heart the minute he came in the story without the author really describing him?  Yeah8230Mal is definitely that character.  The minute he started talking was the minute I fell for his charm8230or should I say humor.Anne Rollins is introduced first in the story and she definitely hasn8217t had it easy.  Her life consisted of taking care of her little sister due to her mom not wanting to be apart of raising them, and then taking care of everyone else she comes in contact with.  She tends to have people take her for granted.  The poor girl though has no one there to tell her otherwise and she8217s way too nice. I wanted to slap her a couple of times for doing things she shouldn8217t for people who obviously used her.  She has her own roommate walk out on her, her boss use her for hours, and several other incidents that happen in the book that I do not want to give away.  The poor girl needed someone to kick her in the butt or make life be more fun for her.In comes the sexy drummer of Stage Dive, Mal who will make you laugh, smile, blush, and curse all at the same time.  He had me laughing up a storm constantly in this book.  The boy says the craziest things though at the best times.One of my favorite scenes is when Mal is drunk and his fellow bandmate, David tried to shut him up.There8217s also several other scenes, one where Mal talks to Anne (but not really her8230LOL..Let8217s just say it8217s a body part )  Yeah, you will have to read the book for this one.Mal ends up meeting Anne when he overhears her at a party talking to her boss.  He8217s going to change Anne8217s world and make it much better (or you may find it kind of stalking or going crazy a bit8230it all depends on how you take it as a reader).  To me, Mal came in and saved the day for Anne.  He made her more fun and she made him open more at the end.  I loved him and he8217s going on my long list of favorite book boyfriends now.  (Shhh8230don8217t tell the hubs)Mal and Anne are steamy together and both of have their own problems they are dealing with.  Anne is able to understand quickly what she needs to fix, but Mal has a hidden secret that Anne tries to pry out of him the minute they make a deal to help each other.  She knows something is wrong and so does the rest of the bandmates, but Mal is determined to keep it hidden or at least try to accept it on his own.Kylie does a fantastic job on keeping my interest throughout the story for these two characters and also the secondary ones.  We have the previous characters in the story and the other bandmates.  We also have Anne8217s friends constantly throughout the book and her sister.  Her sister is quite a character and I have a feeling she8217ll show up again later on in another book.I look forward to reading the rest of the bandmates stories because I8217m now officially addicted to this fictional band.  It also helps when Kylie makes several scenes very steamy between the characters.  (Is it getting hot in here8230kind of feeling when you read the scenes) This is a New Adult Contemporary Romance book that has way more steamy scenes compared to other books I8217ve read in this genre.Another warning though, if you read this book in public be prepared for people staring at you.  There is no way you will be able to hide your giggles and your smiles from Mal8217s crazy personality.  Thank goodness I read this book in the comfort of my home and when everyone slept.I give this book 5 full moons and highly recommend it to readers out there that enjoy rock star romance books and the New Adult/Contemporary Romance genre.Oh one more thing8230that will get you worked up about Mal is when Kylie describes him in detail, especially when he8217s beating on his drum set and how Anne sees him from her perspective.

Anne initially balks at hanging with the band that had been plastered on her walls growing up but decides to forget about her problems for a night.A moment on the balcony to take a call has Anne meeting Malcom Ericson, the drummer for Stage Dive. Mal takes an instant liking to Anne and resolves to insert himself into her life8230starting with moving in to her apartment. Mal needs a pretend girlfriend to make his Mom happy even though he refuses to share exactly why. Anne rolls with it because she needs a roomie and she knows she8217d be stupid to pass up the opportunity to actually live with musician she was all dreamy over.This couple is the embodiment of the old saying that there8217s a match for everyone. There is an immediate chemistry mainly because Anne sees Mal8217s antics as adorable rather than annoying. I can see how some readers may feel like Mal8217s hyperactive one-liners get tiresome, but I just found it charming. Anne is a nice foil for Mal because while she is the steadying force in the relationship, she8217s every bit as playful as he is, although in an understated way.Kylie Scott does a great job of balancing the silliness with real emotion. Anne has had a rather rough go at life and Mal is dealing with some heavy family issues. The couple transitions effortlessly to an affectionate friendship to a deeper relationship with relative ease. The few roadblocks that are thrown their way seem natural to the story and overcome in a mature way.This novel was a welcome change of pace from the more emotional books I usually read and a perfect addition to the Stage Dive series.

Vaun is plagued by ghosts too, feels isolation and adrift. He has used random sexual encounters to numb his pain, but does not really feel anything.They meet and form an immediate connection that defies logic. Soon they are immersed in each other lives and harboring strong feelings. But even as Harper tries to pull away to protect Vaun from her secret and uncertain future, it all is exposed.Will their love be enough to help her in the fight for her life or will Vaun face his biggest loss yet?I have to say that the insta-love in this book was really fast. However, I will admit that even though insta-love usually annoys me, I found their relationship sweet and heart felt. They were both broken before they met from family issues and traumas, but their meeting truly was the beginning of their new lives and new attitude. It did really feel like they had a soulful connection. And they were so consumed by their feelings and were so good for each other that I kind of just went with it.I love you infinity.~HarperI love you infinity plus one.~VaunI think I beat you. There is nothing higher than infinity.I loved you first.You win.Harper was sweet, loving, caring and has an inner strength. She had faced so much in her young life and was facing the hardest battle yet. But even though she had so much going on in her own life, she could still have empathy and concern for Vaun and his struggles. And her care and concern for her little brother was admirable.(Quote)I know I should be embarrassed and I should be worried that I could bare such sorrow to a stranger when I keep it closed from the ones who love me most, but Vaun doesn't feel like stranger. He feels like an old friend. One I had once and lost and found again. A friend who understands my tears aren't a moment of weakness but of love. Vaun and I share a kindred spirit of pain, in so many ways different, but heart altering all the same.Vaun was simply amazing. He was funny, protective, loving, and devoted. From the minute he saw her, she pulled him in. And he jumped head first into wanting more with her even as she tried to pull back and not let him in. From the beginning, he saw their connection for what it was, never fought it or denied it. In fact, he pushed it. And when things were difficult, he pushed them both through it and found way to make a difference in her life. And she had a positive effect on his too by giving him someone to truly care about and also helping him deal with his own feelings of loss and family issues. Since they had been through so much, they both showed much more maturity than typical seventeen year olds.I love you, Blue. I love you more than anything left here on this earth and I think we were meant to find one another. You saved me and now... I'm going to save you.Will you fight? I need to know you'll fight, Blue. That you'll fight so damn hard so we never say goodbye...God and Heaven can't have you you because you're mine, because I loved you first.There was pain, heart break, sweetness, and love. It was difficult, challenging, emotional, and moving. There were parts where I lost my breath, teared up, and wanted to throw my kindle.

The last thing either of them need is to get in to a relationship with each other, fate has a different idea though.'I don't know why but I need Harper to get to know me, not the person everyone sees, the guy I let them see.  I want her to know the real me, the new me, the man I want to be even when everything in the world is stacked up against me.'Harper and Vaun have an intense connection that they can not deny.  Harper tries to keep him at an arms length to keep from hurting him, but he doesn't want to stay away from her.  She finally gives in and allows him in.  She's afraid to let him know her secret though lest he should get hurt, and hurt her in the process.  This is a story of love, understanding, and hope.'I know I should be embarrassed and I should be worried that I could bare such sorrow to a stranger when I keep it closed from the ones who love me most, but Vaun doesn't feel like stranger.  He feels like an old friend.  One I had once and lost and found again.  A friend who understands my tears aren't a moment of weakness but of love.  Vaun and I share a kindred spirit of pain, in so many ways different, but heart altering all the same.'I was literally in tears before I even started the story.  Kerri and Chase's stories (read here:[...] had me bawling.  I took this as a good sign going into the book, as I love nothing more than a story that'll make me cry.  And cry I did. A. LOT.  Harper's story was tragic, but as a parent (and spouse) I was completely devastated by what her father was dealing with.  I just couldn't even imagine how one person could deal with all of the pain that the Kennedy family had been dealt.  I loved her little brother, he was like a little ray of sunshine in the middle of a thunderstorm.  He and Vaun had me laughing more than once.I love you, Blue.  I love you more than anything left here on this earth and I think we were meant to find one another.  You saved me and now... I'm going to save you.Where can I get a Vaun, I think that it is imperative that I have one.  He was so wonderfully supportive, and unwavering in his love of Harper, despite her best attempts to push him away.  After the things that he had just went though the fact that he was able to be the person he was for Harper was amazing.  I was completely blown away by that man, um boy? I'm going with man, anyone who has been through what Vaun has, is a man.The only way you'll be saying goodbye to me is though death and even then I don't want to.  I will remember today, tonight, and tomorrow in your arms, under these exceptionally bright stars which I believe spark just for us.  I will remember the warmth of your arms around me and your smell, the feel of your cotton tee against my cheek.This is an 'instalove' story.  I didn't mind at all, I thought that it worked in this capacity.  I know that a lot of people have it though, so I'm putting it out there.  The pull between these two was so palpable that, as a reader, I knew that they had no choice but to be together.  Their journey was far from typical but it was completely beautiful.  And the understanding of their respective fathers' through their love for one another was amazing. Never Goodbye is not a cliffhanger, hallelujah!!  I don't think that my heart would have been able to handle not knowing the fate of Harper and Vaun!! I really have nothing bad to say about this book, except that I was sad that it was over.  I will be anxiously awaiting April and Carter's story (I hoping for a little more Harper and Vaun, quite honestly!!) due out in early 2014!!Vaun?MmmI love you.He kisses my head.

The cover and title alone really creeped me out. I bought the book and was thinking about it while I made a snack, and already getting scared, before settling in to read it. The concept alone, my grammy is ravenous undead zombie, was seriously clever AND scary.So my heart was beating hard before I powered up myKindle Paperwhite, 6 High Resolution Display with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers.Loved the fast-paced story and the various characters. I wasn't crazy about the fact that these were talking zombies the nonsensical zombie dialogue wasn't funny, more stupid and irritating and slowed down a potentially terrifying story.That said, those with a taste for dark humor will most likely enjoy the parts that annoyed me. I'll admit some parts were hilarious in an utterly black humor creepy kind of way. Think: Rednecks are responsible for the zombieapocolypse. Think: A bunch of elderly zombies are wondering whatsfordinner (although it's more like, Who is for dinner?). Think: This is just the beginning.With a nice set-up, really neat characters (I loved the two brothers), and a clever plot, this is really a good little bit of fiction. If you like comedic-horror and fast-paced serial fiction and Zombie stories, then you will probably LOVE this book.Happy reading~*PS. I liked this book so much that immediately afterward I read J. A.

136040,B0068KP7DQ,"[2, 2]",5,"3 Freshmen: A Comic Novel was an interesting trip back in time to college life in the late 60's and early 70's. It was a fun filled read about the adventures of three young men who became friends as they entered into their first year of college. The story revolves around the experiences of these three characters and the life and times during that era. The three characters are Stand, Darius and Lenny. The story is told by the character Stan.I really enjoyed all of the little details of the storyline throughout the book. It allowed me to be able to visualize what was taking place as though I was there. It was also very interesting to read about what was going on culturally and historically during this period which gave me some real insight as to how it affected the lives of young people during that time. I also really liked how the author mentioned the music and artistic and entertainment influences throughout the book. This story and its events happened well before my time, but I did certainly enjoy the comparison and contrast of college life and world events from then and now. What made the story so refreshing for me was reading the different perspectives of the characters and getting an understanding of their thoughts, concerns, and struggles, encounters with members of the opposite sex and how they lived their lives during that time.This is a great story for anyone who was in college themselves during this exciting and challenging time for a fun trip down memory lane. It is also a great read for anyone who wants to learn more about that time and place who wasn't around during those days. All in all it is a great story that will cause you to smile and relate with the characters in the book.","10 1, 2013",AU6WZTHO3RVFR,My Right Eye,A Refreshing Read,1380585600,1.0,True,5.0

I find reunions to be entertaining when people haven't seen each other for many years, as well. After the reunion, it kind of just fell into a slump for me. The upset that occurred was too depressing and too much of the story focused on it. It didn't hold my attention well, so my mind wandered off. If there is some type of distraction that causes the development of a relationship to be put on hold like that, I prefer something more like an ex-lover causing drama. I was looking forward to the steamy scenes, considering the book cover, but was sadly disappointed. They were too quick for me. I need more detail.

And that strategic...if slightly panicked...retreat isn't going so well. Luc's already had to ditch the sweet Vette he was driving, then crashing, and he's hobbled by the ankle he wrenched when he jumped out a window. He just doesn't have all that many options left. Well...less than not all that many. One. He has exactly one option.The Chevy Nova loudly sputtering at the nearest stoplight.Katie McCabe's life isn't going so hot right now. It hasn't for several months, actually. Not since she caught her fianceacute doing push ups on his desk in his office...with his hot supervisor spotting him from her position underneath him. She may have swept the cheating bastard out of her life...um...literally...but she lost her job at the company over the incident. Apparently taking a broom to his bare ass is considered more indiscreet than his infidelity. Who knew?She's waiting at a stoplight, her beloved but ancient Nova giving her a bit of trouble, when the door to the passenger side is jerked open and a strange man dumps himself into the seat beside her. It isn't until the bullets start flying, though, and the man starts shouting at her to drive, that Katie realizes that she had been wrong about one very important detail. Her life hadn't, in fact, hit rock bottom. It couldn't have, as it's obviously still in a rapid free fall - with gunfire, car chases, and strange men claiming to be federal agents tossed in for that extra bit of terminal velocity!Not that she's freaking out or anything!!Then she finds out that not only is the man chasing them the son of a notorious mob boss, he is a known psychopath, and in saving Luc's life and embarrassing the psycho in front of the cops by just defending herself, she's put herself squarely on his Needs To Be Brutally Killed list and is no longer safe to live her crappy little life. Nope, now she has to live a crappy, life-threateningly dangerous life.Because that is SO MUCH BETTER!She just can't handle one more thing going wrong right now. Not one.Pity, then, that Luc has a few secrets he's refrained from telling her, even as he sets out to keep her safe, because when she finds out who he really is and how they're connected, he's fairly certain the tempestuous woman is going to try to finish the job the mob started.~*~I have to admit, when I picked up this book, my expectations weren't high. I had a fairly open mind about it, but the mention of the mob in the book summary didn't thrill me. I'm not a fan of mob-related fiction. I am, though, quite happy to say that I hadn't even finished the prologue before it was clear that this book was not going to be like anything else I've read recently. Three chapters later and I realized that I had become quickly and thoroughly enchanted.Yeah, yeah, mob related...peripherally, anyway. Didn't give me a problem. And sure, technically its a book that has a suspenseful plotline. Right. Didn't pay much attention to that, though, either. At least not at first. I was too busy being totally enamored by Katie and Luc as characters and falling in love with their quirky charms and the mix of sobriety and humor that is their wacky, rocky relationship.First, the man has a castle that intimidates him a little. Come on, that's priceless! And Katie is a total firecracker. She's quick-witted, sharp-tongued, and feisty as hell...though I wouldn't ask her for directions to the corner store if I were you. She tends to blow up emotionally, then calms down and logics things out in a way that I found very appealing...and, okay, more than a little familiar. And the picture Luc carries in his pocket - and the meaning behind it - gave me all sorts of happy sighs of sappy romantic contentment.I loved them together. Their characters and the arc of their relationship throughout the book is what made it shine so spectacularly. But even without them there were a lot of good things. Katie's mother was an interesting secondary character, and Neacutemes stole every scene he was in. David was wonderful and there is lots of untold story around Melanie, too, and the list goes on.There is actually quite a lot ground covered in the book, and not all of it was comedic. Some of it was realistically sober and sad, some dark and disturbing, and even some sickly upsetting. To be honest, the whole psycho mob son plot thread never really came together for me. The suspense was a nice enough backdrop, sure, and it provided some thrills and chills, but it was a bit inconsistent and didn't blend all that well with other aspects of the book. It also gave some room for Katie to tread over the line into some thoughtlessly dangerous actions that I would consider stupid in any other book. In this case the stupidity was slightly alleviated by the lighter tone of the surrounding narrative. It was more like a dramedy in places than serious suspense that inspires a true sense of danger.It was entertaining, though. Very entertaining. I was caught totally by surprise by this one, and happily so. Now I'm left with a desperate hope that this book segues into a series featuring some of the secondary characters we met here. Neacutemes and Melanie both would be perfect as main characters in their own books (either individually or together). There was tons of stuff throughout the book practically begging for further development, and I refuse to believe that there will be no better resolution to the issue with Katie's parents. I want more of all of it. Please?Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

Three hundred years later, Perci and Luc are Grimm: guardians of mortals, protecting them from the demons that would possess them. But it is time for both to move on, and not together after all they have been divorced for three centuries.It is time for Perci to begin to live again, and she can't do that with Luc, because a part of her still blames him for everything, and although she loves him, it is not the kind of love he needs. When Perci meets her new assignment, sparks fly, in more ways than one. Jack Wallace knows things he shouldn't know as a mortal. He can recognize demons, he can destroy them faster than a mortal should, and he knows about the Grimm. Most important, he makes Perci feel alive for the first time in three hundred years. Can Perci train Jack to be what she is? Now that Perci is feeling again, can she face the past and move on? Will Jack discover who, and what, he was?Shiloh Walker has created a world where fairy tale characters are real people, just not as sweet. These folks are demon hunters, guardians of humans in this modern world. I love how Shiloh Walker finds a way to turn something so familiar into a new and different story. This one is based on a tale of a woman named Persinette, who served as the basis for the Rapunzel fairy tale. It is an intriguing story of love, betrayal, and renewal, with a hidden history between the main characters. I loved the flashbacks, small glimpses into the past shared by Perci and Jack so long ago.Perci is Grimm, and she has stayed with Luc, her ex husband for over three centuries, for all the wrong reasons. She is strong, courageous and one of the best of the Grimm in a fight. But until the powers that be separate her and Luc, she is filled with pain and regret and blame for her past experiences. I loved watching her find her inner strength, and learn to live and love again.Jack is human, but more. Tall, strong and sexy, he sets off alarms in Perci's mind, while igniting a flame inside her, in places she thought long dead. Jack doesn't understand why he knows things, he just does. His mother was a Grimm, until she gave up her wings, so he has always known about them, as well. I loved that his past didn't just come rushing back all at once, but came in small peeks here and there.The secondary characters are all here. Will, the leader they all answer to, is here, but this time there is a vulnerability not seen in him before. I like the small things that make him a more sympathetic character, especially when it concerns Mandy, from a prior book. I look forward to her story in some future book, and I hope to revisit the others from the series as they drop in to help kick demon butt. This is a great reading experience for those who still believe, in their hearts, that fairy tales can come true.Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviews","10 30, 2010",A13QTZ8CIMHHG4,LAS Reviewer The Long and the Short Of It Re...,Fantastic Read,1288396800,0.5,True,5.0
16556,B003HS4VD4,"[13, 15]",2,"Bill Morison relates his experiences as a novice work comp auditor for a large insurance company, a job he finds pointless and boring, in a book that is unfortunately pointless and boring.I'm usually a fan of workplace humor.  Ideally, the author strips away the mundane majority of the work experience, leaving only the enjoyable and/or amusing bits.  Unfortunately, this author manages to find only mundanity.  For instance, he spends more than 200 mundane words (There was a path leading from the parking lot to the pavilion. [...] It was at this entrance that I found the standard park grill.) describing the pavilion at which the company picnic was held - a description with absolutely no relevance to any of the picnic events.  He describes the teambuilding games at the picnic as worthless, provides no other information beyond a listing of games, and then tells the reader that they were the most fun he'd had at the company.  If they were fun, then show the fun!Leaving aside my lack of appreciation of the author's humor, this book has other flaws.- It contains a random creepy advertisement for another of his books,Legon Awakening: Book One in the Legon Series.  It's so good and the author's voice--so hot, and ...but he does have a sexy voice and the story is great, says Bill's coworker Adrian.- It contains random and uninteresting IM conversations between Bill (screen name Bmorisson, or sometimes Bmorrison, but never an accurate spelling of his last name) and Adrian (screen name HorseChick - there's got to be a story behind *that* as your workplace IM name, but unfortunately we don't learn what it is).Bmorisson hey you're on the EAC right?HorseChick yeah why? If your going to complain about the pot luck last week I don't want to hear it wasn't my ideaBmorisson chill. I wasn't going to say anything about that. I'm supposed to be in the meeting this week does that mean I'm on the committee? Oh and pot lucks are dumb.HorseChick lol don't make me walk over there! [...]- The dialogue is stilted, superfluous, or both.Hey bro, how's it going?I'm good, you?I'm doing good.- Compound words are written as two separate words (pot luck, Halloween was making a come back), and separate words as compound words (Everyday, he wore khaki pants with a faded polo).  Not just once or twice, but over and over.- Sentences are randomly strung together.  It was a local number some 720 one.- The author picks the wrong word.  She straitened a bit.

Never did loosing your job seem to affect me.Two stars because the grammatical issues aren't bad enough to make the book completely unreadable, and because the last 30% is significantly better than the first 70%.

It is about making some serious shifts in your thinking to break free from the garage that we all been taught to believe.I love his approach in using everything from Steppenwolf to Copernicus to Ptolemy to illustrate the meaning of being extreme. His ability to put the concept into such an easy understandable way makes for great reading. Anyone who doesn't want to start living life to the extreme after reading this book must be dead, as dead as a dead parrot. And the fact that Ali admits that he himself was at one time, one of those people who lived life in the middle of the road, living life moderately just adds credibility to the book. I have read this book twice and will read it again and again as there is something new each time I go through it.Azizi Ali is the Joel Osteen of learning how to make money. With his down to earth, common sense, yes you can do it approach, this book makes you want to get out there and get started now. No wonder Ali is a bestselling author, he comes at you fully loaded and ready to tell you what you need to know, not what to want to hear. This book is a game changer for sure. For me, the most important quote in the book, one that illustrates the mind-set of Ali and the message that he has is this, You have only one life: why would you want to spend a minute of it doing things you don't love doing?Very powerful stuff! Thanks Azizi Ali for opening my eyes and giving me a stiff kick in the butt!","11 6, 2012",A1U5XB6PCIDLIK,Dennis Waller,I Love This Book! A Fun  Informative Read,1352160000,1.0,True,5.0

243641,B008AL8EUY,"[1, 3]",5,"Rating: 5 starsLuke Landon is spending his birthday by himself, drinking and watching all his ex boyfriends pass by him at the bar, all seemingly happy without him. As the idea of another drink gets a happy internal hell yes, he hears a voice behind him saying the words, Put your clothes back on and get back into your vehicle. The park has now closed.  It's Owen West, back in his life after fifteen years apart.  Their romance in college was so hot, so all encompassing they thought it would never end until it did, neither of them really understanding why.  But now Owen is here on his birthday and they get a second chance at love, a second chance to get it right whether it be luck or fate, if they are smart enough to take the chance.Second Time Lucky reminds me almost immediately why Ethan Day is a must read author for me.  I never think of the personas he creates for his stories as characters, more like people I love listening to and spending time with.  You know, that one friend we are always on the phone with or going out to the bar with them, listening and laughing until our stomachs hurt.  Those are Ethan Day people.  And Luke Landon is another memorable Ethan Day person.  I was grinning with anticipation as I started to read Luke's inner running commentary on his parade of exes at the bar.  After perusing a guy with whom he had a diasterous date, Luke thinks Don't expect a happily-ever-after when you accidently break a man's masturbation hand--life lesson learned. OrUsually, gay men stayed on the same cycle--similar to the menstrual variety in that we did our best to avoid the achy cramps that came with running into our past failures. We instinctively knew what nights and times to avoid certain bars. It was something we normally didn't have to work at.The same way the moon orbits the earth which in turn does the same with regard to the sun, we managed to avoid one another without needing to consciously think.  That's pure Ethan Day.  Funny, sarcastic, a little twisted and totally true. I could quote him all day.Told from Luke's pov, we are privy to all the inner workings of Luke's mind and heart, a complicated duo if ever there was.  Luke's upbringing and current status with his mother make romantic relationships a hard sell. With three gay ex husbands behind her, Luke's mother is not exactly a warm and supportive mother, and Luke's abandonment by his father is an issue still impacting his relationships, whether he acknowledges that fact or not.  Mostly not.  Everything about Luke, from his pride in his work and his loyalty to his friends, makes him someone it is easy to empathize with and understand.  And his constant inner monologue with all his insecurities front and center bubbles to the surface of each page, buoyant on its own effervescence, until it spills over everything in its path, covering all the events with a Lukas perspective, even Owen West.  I really liked Owen West, a steady, good person with his own issues.  I could also get behind his frustrations with Luke even as he understood the basis for Luke's actions.  Yes, Owen West feels like a real person too.  So do all the characters in Second Time Lucky.  I don't need to talk about depth and dimension because it is unnecessary.  They are that real, that authentic.Ethan Day also has a wonderful way with settings, from Missoula, Montana and Owen's family ranch to Middleton where Luke works and lives, it all comes to life with Day's vivid details and small deft touches.  Second Time Lucky is that complete package, full of laughter, outright guffaws, love and as with life, heartbreaking sobs and tears.  Have your box of tissues handy.  At one point in the story, a sudden occurrence hits Luke and the reader at the same time with the same impact.  My heart hurts just thinking about it now. Everything is tied up in a wonderful ending, that will send you back to the beginning of the story to  start reading it all over again. No quibbles here, not even a twinge.  Trust me, you will love this one.  I know I did.  Great job, great story!Cover: Cover by Winterheart Designs.  Very eye catching, very flashy.  Not sure how I feel about it, perhaps a little divided.  From one standpoint I say, yes, that's Lucky but under all that glitz is a man with depth.

867345,B00J3BIBGC,"[0, 0]",4,"I8217m a huge fan of stories that feel new and fresh, with suspense elements that feel possible: you can see the premise for the suspense actually happening.  In Damned If You Don8217t, Parisi manages to mix corporate bottom line with developer8217s conscience and come up with a winner.Morgan is a scientist who is on the bubble of a giant breakthrough: she has developed a formula that will, in pill form, help people to lose weight.  Her bosses at BioClin want an immediate release, but Morgan is not convinced that the product is all it can be, and wants time to sort out the issues.  Big Pharma is the 600 pound gorilla in the room: Morgan doesn8217t stand a chance.  And when the formula is stolen and used on an actual human who doesn8217t survive, Morgan sees no alternative: she steals the formula and documentation from her lab and runs.Jack has been hired by BioClin to recover the formula and bring Morgan to the police.  An Alpha with a past and some serious issues of his own, Jack is quite interesting and intriguing: but his interplay with Morgan is not all that it seems.  And it8217s difficult for Morgan to not find him attractive, even as she is more than capable of reading him the riot act.Morgan is clever: decidedly so, and comfortable with her brains, even as she is a bit over the top about the formula with her own guilt.  Her interactions and reactions to Jack are normal and open, even as she is a bit confused about why he is helping her, and the truth of his involvement is yet to be discovered.I would have liked to have some 8216lead in8217 to the action: this story starts at a full out run and really doesn8217t slow down, so the characters are a bit slow to be understood.  The third person narration also adds to that sense of remove, even though it is crisp and clear, I would have liked some inclusion of character point of view to give a better sense of their own voices, concerns and thoughts.  The characters, despite those little niggles for me are solid and strong with believable connections and concerns, and their relationship is developing in balance, not overwhelming the suspense elements, nor being pushed to the background as filler.  A delicate balance that is so often missed in romantic suspense, Parisi manages to keep both elements in the reader8217s mind, and twist elements together to craft a story that works on both levels.I received an eBook copy of the title from Corvisiero Literary Agency for purpose of honest review.

It all starts out with an invitation to play on an island. None of them have heard of this place or are sure how they found them and their information (you still don't know by the end of the book either). However with the money they are offering each of them each of them thinks of how this money could help in some way. This leads them all to accepting Amy is back in this one as well because Sam is allowed to bring a guest and the assume that she will be with him. Sam isn't letting Amy away from him for any longer than he has to so of course she will be going. What they find on the Island of Eden is a place where everyone is accepted no matter what your preference might be. All can't run smoothly for the crew or we wouldn't have a story LOL. Darla has never ridden in a plane and has a slight freak out. Joe's mysterious ex shows up and sends Joe into a panic.

The author hasn't let me down with the follow up of the first book in this fan-bloody-tastic series. The sex is reach for the fan as soon as you can material! But at the cutting edge of a good read is without a doubt, the plot. It8217s so down to earth, so feasible, but at the same time, so unpredictable that you8217ll be on tenterhooks. And that is exactly what I look for in a good book.Stella and Gabe have big problems with a capital B! No pun intended on my part! And the only way to solve them is to make a pact of sorts. Hence, the Alphabet Game. How on earth Gabe (the author), dreamt it up is beyond me! Book 1 leaves us hanging on a steep cliff when Stella has an extremely unpleasant surprise.Book 2 flows perfectly from the last paragraph of A to E to F to K. Now she8217s made a decision of sorts. Not to get involved and take matters into her own hands. She8217s had enough of Gabe8217s luscious invention, and even though she8217s got the gist of it, she misses playing the game. Easier said than done when you8217ve got a gorgeous hunk of a man with muscles in all the right places who begs for forgiveness with her one weakness, MMs!It wouldn8217t be fair if I told you more however, vengeance is supreme in this fast and quite hilarious story of two lovers that don8217t want to get involved. Past issues are of utmost importance and will this bring them together or pull them apart? Coincidences collide, secrets are unfolded, and trust is questioned. I really must tell you that these two loveable characters8217 personalities are simply described to perfection. The banter between the protagonists had me reading out aloud and laughing even louder.

Ava is a leopard, like Shane, and she was sold into slavery as a baby and trained to be an assassin. Ava is seven now and she's sort of a scary little girl. Most of the other shifter children in the coalition don't like to play with her, mainly because in Ava's mind play involves a knife and someone dying. But this Christmas she is determined to prove that Santa doesn't exist, so she asks for a baby for Carson and Keegan, knowing full well Santa won't be able to deliver.It's now Christmas Eve and Shane and his team are hunting a feral snake shifter and the evil that controls him. As it turns out, the evil is Carson's uncle who has been presumed dead for years. Killing the snake and its master before Christmas morning becomes the priority.

The story has genuinely interesting settings and events, colorful characters, and some genuine heartfelt emotions. By the time I got to the end, I loved it. By Amazon's rating standards, that warrants five stars. While it's not a highly-refined literary masterpiece, the story does pull you along in an engaging fashion, and leaves you smiling and wanting just a little bit more.James Taylor (please don't call him Jimmy) just returned home to Lawder, the small southern town where he grew up. He left earlier to make his way in NYC as a motion picture promoter, and had a string of successes, but when everything he valued fell apart, he returned home. A dead lover, his failure at being a friend, betrayals from others he considered friends, he returned shell-shocked and quetioning all that he believed, and just wants to stay in Lawder for a while to regroup under the care of his mom, the one person left whom he could trust. But there's one shock left for him upon his return. One that threatens to ruin the security of home that he so craves. His mom, Bea, runs a landscaping firm, and her head employee (Kevin), the person she adores as another son, is the junior-high bully nicknamed Brick that used to torment James and make his life miserable. James' most painful moments as a child were a result of the merciless tormentings and beatings from Brick, one of which even required a hospital visit and stitches. Because Brick is so apologetic, James must try to reconcile this long-carried hatred, and this turns out to be just the first step in his healing process.The story is told in third-person perspective centered on James and those immediately around him. It's more than just a story of James' healing, it's a story of his personal growth. Whether it's the revelations that he's making the same mistakes he made in NYC, or that he's searching for things he already has if only he would just stop and look, it's a lengthy journey that takes place over the better part of a year.They characters are genuinely colorful, interesting, and even lovable. From his straight-talking mother to his neighbor (and exotic-dancer) Stephani to the pot-smoking, gay-friendly, ex-Ranger police captain Jerry to the bitter, cruel, and troubled homophobic teenage boy Cory, the story is filled with wonderful characters that delight. The events that occur are the typical events of any small southern town. Picnics, guys' night out at a strip club, poker games... everything that happens is basic and real and just what you'd expect in any small town. What brings them to life are the characters, and by the time the book is finished, you'll wish you could meet some of these people. Strong language and adult situations are kept to a minimum. There is use of alcohol and marijuana in the book and some graphic descriptions of a few body parts (like when they went to a strip club), but there is no erotica and the previous examples are kept in a light, and very often humorous, tone (Please please tell me I did not tickle our Chief of Police last night while I was drunk!). Yes, there's quite a bit of humor in the story too, making it all the more entertaining and enjoyable.The writing style is pretty simple. Events are told clearly, and there's only a few small grammatical errors. Peppered through the book are a few moments when the writing does transcend and become something more, and as a whole, it works very very well. It's a friendly, unpretentious style, like an old familiar friend, and this makes it easy to fall into the story and become quickly engrossed. All in all, it's a welcome and pleasant surprise and I heartily recommend it.","07 29, 2012",A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP,"Robert Carnevali Typical, middle-aged guy",An engaging and sweet story,1343520000,0.0,False,5.0

While in the military, Knox gets inured pretty badly after an explosion. A volunteer is the hired to assist him with everyday life. Enter Charlotte Davenport (Charlie). Charlie is not your average heroine. She is sassy, confident, and has a mouth of her. She was raised by her dad and takes no nonsense. Charlie also has a bad past when it comes to love.The attraction is immediate when Knox and Charlie meet for the first time. And the second time. Charlie ends up being the volunteer to help Knox.

It was natural and went with the flow of the story. It's a perfect mix of sweet, sexy, steamy. They are both so stubborn and refuse to be genuinely nice to each other. There is always a slight sexual undertone in their interactions. They both feel it, but refuse to give in for awhile. When they do give in, it's passionate, heart-felt, and captivating. When you've been hurt it's hard to give someone your heart again. But sometimes, a person is worth that risk. Knox saw that risk and took it anyway. Every emotion. Every word. I FELT it. Do you hear that? That's my heart beating for Knox. He gave me ALL THE FEELS. I held on to every word. When Knox speaks it is with truth and conviction. And when he loves, watch out. It. Is.

She represented everything he swore never to go back on, but he couldn't stay away from her. It's about time a heroine like Charlie came along. She is fun, strong, and completely irrevocably in love with Knox. The build up of their feelings is the heart of this book. It allows you to fall for Knox and Charlie.

Of course, the 3 friends think this is a safe bet that they are not going to loose.The Fireside Inn is a short, sweet, sexy love story with no explicit love scenes and not too much angst. Leo meets Serena, a librarian on Sanctuary Island and they both feel an instant attraction and connection to each other. Both Leo and Serena have their own issues and this novella is about learning to trust another with your personal story and with your heart. Leo and Serena are both from completely different lifestyles and backgrounds and it felt like an old fashioned boy-meets-girl love story with no outside negative distractions or influences. At times I did feel a bit rushed in certain places but for a short novella, it still had emotion and I was curious to see how the story ended.Overall The Fireside Inn was a light, enjoyable read.Next in line is Zane's story, followed by Cooper's.","01 24, 2014",A320QB8QO0OTPT,Artfullee,"Sweet, Short love story",1390521600,0.0,False,3.0
162586,B006V3FJ4M,"[1, 2]",3,"This is a nice little story of a boy who is witness to and affected by the arrival and actions of a witch. The witch comes to town and gently turns things a bit upside down. The witch's adjustments were involving the things in the town (money, goods, etc.). The primary character is the boy, and it describes his perception of and actions towards the witch.I found that the story did not flow that well for me, with very little background information on the characters, and it seemed to lack the element that tied all the adjustments together - in other words, I did not truly get a sense of what the author intended the purpose of the adjustments to be. When reading the story, it felt like I had been thrown into a town of strangers and was a bystander watching all this come about, which may be what the author was trying to achieve. I came up with my own moral of the story, and would be interested in knowing if anyone else felt similarly, and would really like to find out if the author's intentions were anything close to what I discerned, below:What I believe got from the story was that we are all a mixture of good and evil, some having more bits of one or the other, and that we decide which path to take and which way to live, yet we can also profoundly affect the paths chosen by others by the way we respond to them. The boy in the story, who treated the witch kindly despite his hesitation, influenced others to treat her a bit more kindly, and was ultimately rewarded beyond belief for his kind treatment of the witch.Despite all, the story is interesting, creative, short, and simple, yet thought provoking, and I felt satisfied with ending.This story is fine for teens.","05 1, 2012",A2O7DVG5OB9WSU,Kindle Customer,Nice little story,1335830400,0.5,True,3.0

The tricky thing is that Nick is investigating Carlie and she is hiding from men like him.There are many reasons why I loved this romantic suspense! First, the characters. Nick is the total Alpha male, plus he's protective and loyal at all costs. I loved his patriotism and dependability as an undercover agent for a top-secret organization. And I always love a man with a gun and a desire to protect his woman! Carlie also was a believable character with an astounding story behind her and a strong desire to be safe. She doesn't trust many people, and the fact that she knew she could trust Nick right off was endearing (although maybe she shouldn't have trusted him ... you'll have to read to find out).I loved the twists and turns in this read. Love  Deception was full of suspense and I'm usually good at deducting what happens in mysteries right off. Not in this case!Every chapter had me thinking new possibilities and the ending is where it truly comes out. (The end was my favorite part!)My last reason for loving this story is the political issues involved. Most people probably wouldn't say that, but I'm a politics nut and I think terrorism is a viable concern in our world today. Rhondeau did a great job tying in this important theme throughout the book, without being offensive, but striking a chord with reality.This is a great read with the right amount of suspense, love, romance, sexiness, and adventure at every corner.

All he needs is proof.The David's aren't your typical family. They're loaded, powerful, and well-positioned to avoid life's consequences. Junior is a spoiled playboy with a penchant for drugs and violent sex. Senior is a businessman with an agenda. The two, combined, are shady at best, so when Junior's fiance is hurt, they're willing to stop at nothing to save their name and family fortune. They didn't see Keeper Marconi coming.Along with his sidekick, a former inmate named Blood, Marconi blurs the lines of private investigating and refuses to heed warning that the David family isn't one to be messed with. Blood who hails from the wrong side of Albany, NY, a place Zandri writes with the authenticity of a local, is a nice addition to the cast of characters. This being my first time reading Zandri, an author somewhat out of my usual horror, paranormal, and urban fantasy genres, Blood provided a familiar element of the flawed ex-villain turned good guy.The book moves along at a nice pace and while I'm not sure the 50 Shades angle really did anything for the plot other than lend pop culture notoriety (Junior could've been any garden variety pervert), it had me wondering what exactly DID happen to the somewhat one-dimensional Sarah.Introduced in the beginning as a love-sick tart and reluctant participant in Junior's sex games, Sarah is the part of this book that fell flat for me. The book, written from Marconi's point-of-view, feels like his story, with full emotional detachment from the victim. That might well be a staple of the genre and only takes away from the story, for me, in hindsight. Sarah is a single mother with her heart turning her back home, to a loving ex-husband and a normal life. A lot could've been done there that was left in the periphery.Overall, a good read with enough intrigue to keep you turning the pages.

Yeah, there were some scenes that made me feel a little awkward, but nothing too serious. I really enjoyed the story and the incredible suspense that radiated from between the pages.The whole first half you are not entirely sure if this is going to be a paranormal read or not. It is crazy intense not knowing and trying to figure out what exactly is wrong with Luca. Which leads me to him. I adored him, I hurt for him, and I wanted to protect him...throughout the whole read. He was in desperate need of some help and Eva was just the right girl for the job. She had this desperate and urgent need to be around him and mend him.

181624,B007B1WH02,"[3, 5]",3,"I read this book in a free preview and it did nicely fill the seven hour flight I was on (and I have a kindle with 700 titles, 1 that I haven't read yet).What drew me in was the initial explanation of the gods and how religions came into play.  I have read ideas where prayers are like food to the gods, or that the gods formed out of the collective will of the masses, or (my favorite) Brian Stablefords philosophical deity battle royal Werewolves of London series.  Laszlo's gods have much more at stake, and their involvement in human day-to-day affairs is almost more terrifying than a suicide bomber's creed.The characters (Seth, his brother Garret, and Ashton, their friend with supernatural healing powers) weren't fleshed out.  Often motivations were spelled out phonetically making them seem stiff and cardboard instead or organic.  I did read a review that compared this series to Twighlight, and while I disagree heartily, they do share a commonality in explaining themes.  While Twighlight mentioned Romeo  Juliet twelve times in forty pages, the romance between the main characters (Seth and Sara) is thoroughly,  assiduously, carefully, completely, comprehensively, conscientiously, earnestly, efficiently, exceedingly, exceptionally, extremely, flat out, from A to Z, from top to bottom, fully, hard, highly, hugely, in and out, in detail, inside out, intensely, intensively, meticulously, notably, painstakingly, remarkably, scrupulously, strikingly, sweepingly, through and through, throughout, unremittingly, told for several chapters.  They know each other for two days. I know teenagers do this, but reading about it was difficult.  Also, the Sara character seemed insipid with no real motivations or skill.  It was as bad as the character in my own book [...] (It's for sale, but I don't recommend it).I was caught up in the adventure, and I thought that the small town to big adventure was handled well, without cliche.  All stories have to start somewhere, and the great fantasy's start out on common ground Hobbiton, Shady Vale, etc.  This one begins in Vineleaf, has the obligatory these are our weapons and skills moments, tearful goodbye's, and so on.  Laszlo doesn't make it boring, though!  I've read this kind of beginning, and while old-hat readers of fantasy can get bored with it, it is one of the few ways to quickly introduce the reader into who they are dealing with and what the world at large is.My only real complaints were the good fortune (or Author Ex Machina) that the characters seem to have.  It bothered me about the Lord of the Rings when all the hobbits rested up in Tom Bombadil's house and he sang them ENDLESS songs and fed them and made them comfortable.  To me it undermined the seriousness of their journey.In Goldings Lord of the Flies, we are spared of the demise of Ralph by the perfect arrival of a Naval Officer (Golding admitted that he wrote that ending convey to the audience the terrible fate which would have afflicted the children (in particular Ralph) if the officer had not arrived at that moment).In the Choosing, I know that the god's have their hands in the affairs of mortals in this book, but I felt like the author had his hand in it a little more.  The Seth character is given a gift for Ashton's miracle.  Why?  The hero's pay half price, all others pay full.  Why?  The motivations of these secondary characters seemed tacked on and forced.  It seemed too easy that with no training in weaponry, the protagonists would defeat a skilled assassin.  Seth wins the girl by looking mean.If the god's acted so obviously would there not be more suspicion among the characters?  I expected at least one character to say Well, that was easy.  To me, that would have been a little smoke blown to cover the author's hand, and make the good fortune slightly more sinister.I recommend this book to young females who don't read very much fantasy.  It's a good deviation from some of the more popular teen fiction out there.

It also advises practicing living in a state of non-duality while living in a dualistic world.  The Path to enlightenment is realizing there's nothing to find, nowhere to go, nothing to achieve.  Truth is revealed by dropping all attachments and all desires.These are difficult concepts for the average Westerner to understand and accept.  Duality is a part of our lives.

Secrets are being kept and when a ghost from Hannah8217s past arrives, she starts to think whether it is time for her to leave this stable life behind and finally start living the other half of her life.The blurb of the book doesn8217t promise anything too exciting: a family who goes on holiday together to the South of France. However, after just a few chapters, I was already somehow captivated by Hannah8217s voice and the story I found myself in. Hannah appears to be incredibly normal she8217s a housewife and a mother, someone who prefers to hide her problems instead of confront them. Yet, as the story progresses, the reader can see Hannah8217s struggle and the fact that she isn8217t as happy with her life as it might appear from the outside. The flashbacks to the past definitely helped with that, because we get a glimpse into what could have been.

A new vixen has entered the scene and Troy is put under a seductive spell cast upon him by his assistant.Red Phoenix uses this premise to tell a story that many a reader may have experienced in their own lives. Who hasn't had a crush on a coworker or imagined that coworker in a more intimate setting? Perhaps you yourself have created a fantasy of being seduced by a coworker or to seduce them. It is that premise that makes the story more impactful to the reader. And although some of the verbiage used flirts with a more raunchy aspect, it is the way that the story is told that makes for an steamy tale.As always, with a Red Phoenix book, the writing is well done and the presentation is well thought out. The story itself is more involved than just a quickie, but focused enough to convey to the reader that this is erotica, not a story that just has erotic scenes.A very seductive tale that presents itself with depth and imagination.","04 28, 2012",A19GTQ0YMXO8VW,Shane - AFR,Workplace seduction equals homeplace fun.,1335571200,0.8333333333333334,True,4.0

Walter, (the killer), is one slick little pervert of a person. That was saying it nicely. I cannot wait now for the 3rd book, and hopefully the capture of this monster. The romance between Gentry and Lauren, was beautifully weaved into this story. The suspense for me is off the chart. I love all the books that J. L. Has written, I do follow her on Facebook closely. I devour each book she shares with us. So each of her Books have been a thrill ride for me, always leaving me to wonder, how does she do it. I think Amazon needs to have rating up to 10 star , because her books deserve nothing less. Please don't take my word for it, get yourself a copy of the first in this , Murder in the Park series, (Love me Anyway), then you will be running to get the 2nd book. I love love love, these books. The characters in all her books are so well developed, you feel yourself walking beside them, feel there pain, frustration, and hearts. I could go on and on. I cannot wait for the next book to come out and see if this evil, sick little monster will finally get caught, even if he does not, I am sure we will continue in a very interesting ride.

That is the decision Clarissa Miles had to make, and now the payment for that safety is coming due. Seven years ago, Clarissa sold her soul to protect her father, and now the demon that holds the contract is calling it in. She has just seven days left to put her affairs in order, before leaving all she holds dear behind for a `life' with Seven, the demon holding her contract for her soul.Ever since becoming her familiar, Logan Scott has made his desire for Clarissa clear, and she is tired of denying her feelings for him. She decides she will indulge in one brief and passionate fling with Logan, before she is gone forever. But she didn't take into account the determination of one very hot and sexy werewolf to keep what is his, and Clarissa is definitely his. Can Logan and the coven find a way to defeat Seven and bring Clarissa home? Will Clarissa save one soul from the demon before going? And will the coven discover just what Seven is before it's too late?This is a terrific follow up to Ms. Redford's first of this series, and I have been waiting for Clarissa and Logan's story. I enjoyed seeing the characters from book one again, and seeing the progress they have made.Clarissa is determined to be strong, and face her choice without complaint. I like that she makes no excuses or apologies for what she has done, and that she is determined to face Seven with dignity, but she doesn't count on losing her heart to Logan. I enjoyed watching as Clarissa decided to strike out and stop Seven from claiming more souls, even as she knows she is doomed. I loved the strength she had throughout this story.Logan is a hot and sexy werewolf, determined to claim his mate. And he knows, deep down where it counts, that Clarissa is the only one for him. I loved watching as he gets what he wants, only to realize that he wants forever, and then discovers he is going to lose her to Seven if he can't figure out how to beat the demon once and for all. I love that Logan never gives up, and fights for what he wants.This is a story of love overcoming all obstacles, and the lengths we will go to beat evil. I enjoyed watching the coven unite to save one of their own, and it was fun visiting the coven house and seeing Gloria and Mrs. Peach. The secondary characters are a delight, and the humor here is integral to the story at times.

She is a book dealer and also takes on the job of a library organizer. She didn't really think of the scandal that it would cause being an unchaperoned female in the house of Lord Rexton, but she is already hearing the gossip soon after she arrives. She needs this commission so she has to do the job, but why does her employer have to look so handsome.Dominick Avery, Viscount Rexton is really smart and loves philosophy, but because of his looks he is never taken serious as a scholar. His father told him he would only ever be known for his looks as everyone calls him Lord Adonis because of his extremely good looks. He learns at an early age to adapt to it and soon becomes known as the Master of Love.Dominick and Callista's attraction to each other can't be denied, although her reputation is at stake. Dominick does everything that he can to help silence the rumors that she is his lover all the while that is what he wants her to be. Callista is the only one who sees Dominick for who he really is and intelligent man worthy of affection instead of his false persona of the Lord Adonis or Master of Love.Callista finds out that someone wants to harm Dominick and she will do anything to protect him even if he would hate her for it. Doing this eventually puts her in harms way instead.Master of Love is a good historical romance story with great main characters as well as secondary characters. Callista is a strong heroine and I know back then that it was hard for a women to have any sort of respect for being in a trade even if it was the only way to put food on the table for her family. Callista didn't let it deter her and held her head high even when those would gossip around her. Dominick is sexy and down to earth for a Viscount. He was nice to Billy, the footboy, when most would have thrown him in jail for his disrespectful attitude towards someone above him. He had a hard time showing his true self because he was self conscience about his love for writing philosophy. I felt sorry for him that he couldn't be his true self at the beginning, but you would think that being so rich he wouldn't care what people thought.Two things  that bothered me with this book was why Callista didn't just go and tell Dominick what she suspected about his proteacutegeacute instead of doing the wild thing that she did. I understand her hesitation and not wanting to falsely accuse the man but still. The next thing was the epilogue, I really just didn't think it was needed. The sex scenes that was in the story were steamy enough without putting something in the epilogue. I just didn't like that that was the way the author chose to end the story.I would recommend this novel for anyone who loves historical romance stories.","02 21, 2013",A12ZPJFWDG6S4P,Stormi Johnson,Good historical romance. :),1361404800,0.0,False,4.0

The only exception is the small autonomous zone of Free City at the northern end of the Shannon River valley in what was once known as the Republic of Ireland.Chapman8217s novel with fascinating characters inhabiting the gritty post-apocalyptic world of 2446 is a thoroughly enjoyable fare with Inspector Second Class Ryo Trop, at age fifty-five, a recently semi-retired from the Free City Inquisitor's Office, as its main protagonist. He is the guardian to twelve-year-old Dilma Trop, former parlormaid for the now-deceased Dimitri Verhovnyi, the Supreme Imperial Warlord of the Outer Reaches. Trop is considered by many to be second only to the Chief Inspector in investigative abilities. But he is faced with a daunting task when someone starts murdering lowly workers. Will he be able to solve the mystery before more workers are killed? And why would anyone want to kill Space Debris Salvage workers?The author created a truly superb but dark and gritty world with endangerment and rogues prowling around every inhabitable space. Some of the more memorable players in the story include Dr. Jana Fesai, Chief Inspector Helga Bennet of the Free City Inquisitor's Office, Sabra MacFarland, Commander of Covert Operations and Feudal Master of Paramilitarist Serfs Freacutedeacuteric Rameau, Professor Malcolm Evans, Sabina Finney, Captain Philip Takahashi, Daniel Kufuzu - the Exalted Warlord of EurAfrica, Mixion Fahmi, and Fiefdom Liaison Agent and Attack Craft Pilot Keira Norton.

We never find out, as the author doesn't bother to tell us.  We do know that her brother is mean to her.  Her father returns home unexpectedly and he receives a scolding.  And then her father invites her to an unwordly school where she will study with representives from all five worlds and meet her (multiple) soulmates.  Is this information surprising to Tiffany?  Did she know there were other worlds?  We don't know, as the author doesn't bother to tell us.  What do the other species look like (other than being totally beautiful, having great eyes, and looking exactly like girls but being boys)?  We don't know, as the author doesn't bother to tell us.The author seems to be setting the stage for a multi-species free-for-all with Tiffany's body as the playing field once Tiffany, her best friend, and her family make it to the training ground.  It fades out at this point, so I imagine Tiffany and her totally-female-looking-but-totally-male soulmates have all sorts of adventures, Tiffany's brother continues to get what he deserves for being a big meaniehead, and Tiffany continues to just Mary-Sue the heck out of us.The writing is extremely rough in this story.  Basic grammatical principles are completely ignored and the dialogue is beyond stilted (I really should have known, as there is at least one word spelled wrong in the item description).

Day one is initial, day two he gets to make changes with day three being the permanent one, that all involved in his day remember.The story begins with Chance hearing of the murder of Christian turned pop star, Prima.  Chance is now a man on a mission to prevent the murder on second attempt of day one, and when this succeeds, his plan for last and final living of day one will be to  videotape the encounter, but things don't go as planned and the young songstress is killed.The twists and turns that follow are like none I have seen in a book before, and at times I had to go back as I was lost as to the who, what, where or when.  There are many characters to keep track of, all adding to the intrigue and at times fun read, but sometimes too much to keep track of.And then there are stories within stories, a missing 5 year old Wendy, a cult like compound which borders the camp Chance's sister Lucy works at, and underground of bunkers that apparently few know of, and more.Chance has his hand in all of these stories, while being trailed by different characters, and you never know whom he is going to be facing when the hand reaches out and touches his shoulder.Definitely a very good read but one that requires your full attention.  Not one to be picked up just before bed, as it will keep you reading and like Chance who gets up at 4 am every day, you will find yourself lacking in sleep!This story leaves me with the one thing my mom always said, Live today as if it is your last, as it may well be.

One character tells another who's been seeing a psychologist:  That must be a tough job, trying to find something in your head.I loved reading this book--although I feel I should warn potential readers they might do as I did and spend more time laughing than reading.Lou is a 29-year-old gay man, still living at home with his parents in a small town in southern England working for what Americans call the postal service. And despite his desperate attempts to land a boyfriend, not one has yet made even a shadowy appearance in his life.Lou's fatal flaw: he falls in love with straight men, although fit gay men who act like straight blokes can tempt him as well. Unfortunately, none of the men in either of those camps appears to have much interest in Lou--except to bask in his attention and manipulate him for their own purposes.Fortunately, on the other hand, that doesn't stop our feisty Lou with his self-admitted stalker-like tendencies. Another ingenious scheme always arises from the ashes of the last one to go down in flames.I should also note that Lou is the epitome of an unreliable narrator, and that only adds to the fun. Consider this: I was struggling to get served due to the barmaid taking an instant dislike to me. She could clearly see that I thought I was too good for the place. The last nine words of those remarks are the only ones the reader can be sure are true. One suspects the busy barmaid simply hadn't noticed him, and that was what made him feel he was too good for the place.One word seems to stick to Lou. When his sister-in-law Christina chides him on his total lack of success in finding a boyfriend, he says: I'm waiting until the right man comes along. What's wrong with that? Christina sees her chance: There's waiting and there's being delusional. That's the word: delusional.Even Lou admits he was at his happiest when his head was in the clouds. And so was I.I highly recommend Head in the Clouds Much? to any reader in search of hilarity.(As originally reviewed on Rainbow Book Reviews.

Dargon is the Captain of the spaceship Oethra 7, and Alpha is a symbiote that is usually attached to Dargon but can move by itself at times of need.

The first couple of days at ESPA weren't great for Lucy, in fact she started failing her classes and couldn't perform well on stage because she doesn't know who she was now without her sister. She was drowning in sadness, until she heard the music. Beautiful music coming from the heating vents. Needing to find where her inspiration was coming from she followed the music, going through obstacles to find the musician. And then one day, She found him. A handsome musician named Chris. His music has given her the strength to perform again and feel for the first time since Kate's death. As Lucy and Chris start their relationship everything is great, but Lucy must now ask herself a question.

I can see the attraction, though. He is alpha and grunty, and deep down he is licking his wounds from the murder of his wife.  Ripe for a mended heart, right?Carmen is a new doctor at the local supernatural clinic.  She is the daughter of a wolf shifter, but only on her father8217s side. She is an empath, but she isn8217t a wolf.  Her father and uncle are a bit obsessed with shifter politics and want to drag her into it. They don8217t take no for an answer, unfortunately, and target her for a magic attack.  It8217s a good thing she caught Alec8217s eye when Kat was brought into the clinic.  He swoops in to save the day and the two of them swiftly become tangled up in one another on a primal level.  Of course, later, it turns into something much more.In a lot of ways, this book felt like a turning point for the series.  Yes, there was evidence of a bigger picture in the earlier books, but here, the scope of everything seemed to grow exponentially.  We8217re introduced to more characters who will obviously help provide future stories down the road.  And the actions of our main cast change the paradigm in which the New Orleans shifters have been living.It8217s significant stuff, and it pushed the romance back a little for me.  Also a factor was the speed in which Carmen and Alec fall in love.  We8217re talking, what, two weeks?  I know all the empathic stuff was mitigating, but I had a hard time believing in the evolution of their feelings 8211at least to the depth in which they surface.  I could also do without the dom/ sub stuff in the bedroom, though it is admittedly mild.I did like both characters, though.  And they do seem to fit.

Would any of the characters even survive?While I enjoyed the tension and the mystery as students started to disappear from Kat8217s new school, it took me a while to get into the story since the start is about Kat adjusting to her new life. This is a spin off of another series, so I felt like I was missing some inside information, and wasn8217t exactly sure how the paranormal elements of this world mixed in with the normal elements8212like where do angels fit in, how do the non-gifted think of magic, etc. There was talk about how in her previous school other students called her names for being telekinetic and pretty much bullied her, but if that happened in my school, I would be freaking out and running the other way. The last thing I would be doing would be bullying someone who could send projectiles my way.However, we do get a lot of explanation for why Kat8217s gifted, and I enjoyed the mythology here as to why some people are gifted and how it8217s not all unicorns and rainbows for them.

From the very first sentence I knew this was an author who could write and I couldn't wait to see what this story would bring.  I thought she captured perfectly the insecurity and independence of someone who left a small town for university life.  Her style, world building, and plot development was brilliant and highly engaging.  I loved the switching of POVs and each character had a unique voice.  I found it easy to adjust to the shifting of tones.  The main and supporting characters were fleshed out nicely and believable.  The rawness and veracity of the thoughts, emotions, and motivations of protagonists Jeremy  and Beck was refreshing and made the story so much more enjoyable.  Jeremy's spicy, spitfire attitude was delightful and amusing, especially when juxtaposed with Beck's outward show of reservation and quiet, subtle command.  I really loved the tension between the two as they meet one another and flirt in that innocent yet sexy way that occurs as two people test the waters in determining not only their chances with one another, but also in this case the discreetness and carefulness of discovering the other's sexuality.  The relationship throughout was filled with the right amount of angst and sensuality to keep it fresh and exciting.  I thought the conflicts, some used many times before in this genre, were handled in a believable fashion.  I believe this is due to the setting of the novel as well as the author's amazing story telling ability and beautiful writing style.  There were so many lines from the book that I wanted to highlight and store away to keep forever.I loved that this book was plot focused with an appropriate amount of sex thrown in.  There were several instances that I though the author was going to sacrifice plot for meaningless and excessive sex scenes but always I was pleasantly and gratefully surprised that this wasn't the case.  In fact, not only did these scenes not detract from the story, but they served as important moments to push the plot along as well.  Readers who are familiar with the abundance of useless sex scenes in this genre will appreciate this author's dismissal of such a tool.  As far as the steamy scenes go, they were hot, well written, and contained elements that I've rarely read in other m/m books, something I found added to the uniqueness and distinctness of this author's style.As far as negatives go, there aren't many.  My biggest niggle is the smattering of punctuation errors throughout the book, consisting mainly in the form of missing quotation marks.  It wasn't terribly distracting, but a bit discerning considering the author seems well educated and has a degree in English.  Also very minor was the fact that the main characters seemed to have the same classes everyday, something which does not occur in a collegiate setting.  A good editor should have picked up on these things and made them an easy fix.  The climax of the story and the events leading up to it seemed to happen quickly and the resolutions were almost too convenient.  I also felt like the fight that occurred around this time would not have gone on for so long in real life given that there were police officers present as well as an adult who wasn't entirely informed about the surrounding circumstances.  Also, while I would have found it believable that some of the characters accepted Beck's coming out and relationship with Jeremy, it was too much of a stretch to believe that virtually all of the cast, especially Jeremy's parents, displayed such easy reception.  As someone who grew up in a rural, southern town similar to the one presented in this story, I feel that such universal acceptance, while ideal, is rare and unusual, even among a university setting.  To me, it seemed the author wrote such responses to make this book a feel-good read and happy ending for her characters.  Finally, there was one exchange between two very minor characters that I know was included to set up a future book in this series.  The scene actually did serve to enhance and move this story along, but I felt the same effect could have been produced with a few simple sentences depicting the actions of these two characters, rather than the inessential and almost awkwardly placed and awkward to read dialogue that was written.Pinned is a beautifully written, do not miss book.  Jeremy and Beck were wonderful protagonists to ride along with, and their story was gripping.  The few criticisms I have do not mar the book in any substantial way, and are far outweighed by everything that is right about this novel.  The length is perfect and I felt satisfied after reading Beck and Jeremy's story, although I am now eagerly and impatiently waiting for the next installment of the SSU Boys series that I know is sure to come.

Page after page I was riveted on this journey with two wonderfully written characters, Ellen and Brian, who I cant wait to see in the 2nd book.

This book starts out easily enough but within a couple of chapters, you realize that there are all kind of secrets going on and people who you thought were human ,well they weren't ,which is OK because Cynthia is very good at explaining that though some of her charectors may be paranormal,the basic person they were is still there ,is just changes when needed or when the full moon is out. These were all new charectors none were related as far as I know to any of the people in her other books,which is good because that means that it is good as a stand alone,or this could be a novella introduction to a full fledged novel ,either way Im happy. Cynthia Eden has been my no 1 favorite author for years and though I don't think she could write a bad book, even if she ever wrote a bad book,it would better than most authors best books!!!!!I have been trying to think of a way to be more desciptive of why the book is so good but I can't think of a way of doing it without giving away a spoiler,so what I will say is that as usual her book is excellenty written and of course very steamy. That is another thing I love about her books ,is that they are always steamy and erotic,they do not cross the line into cheap porn which I find fantastic because in the end,even though the book involved paranormal charectors (which I LOVE) it is still at heart a romance book with a HEA ending. Right now this book is on sale for $2.99-you should get it now,cause once word gets out how good it is,the price may go up!!

But she feels she has time and doesn8217t need to date because one day she will be called by the Trinity Masters to meet her two perfect partners the grand master has chosen for her. Then she gets her letter early and is placed with two equally dominant and powerful men. Men she has absolutely no idea how to handle!Price and Gunner are the ultimate alpha males. Price being a billionaire who is the CEO of his own security company and Gunner who is an FBI agent have been paired with sweet shy virgin Deni. Gunner is elated since he already knew her but Price isn8217t so sure. Together they must come together to build a strong lasting relationship and along the way they must each learn their roles in that relationship.Gunner and Price! OH. MY. GOD. I seriously LOVED them! Not only are they demanding (in a good way) and totally dominating but they are sweet and caring and totally taken with Denise. It's really sweet! And I really enjoyed Deni! She's no pushover so it was fun seeing her challenge her men. She really had them wrapped around her little finger!This was a great read! I recommend this to ALL erotica lovers! You haven't read erotica until you've read these two ladies! This series is unique and so so sexy and seriously, the characters are fantastic!

Isis is still in the hospital dealing with her memory loss after the events at the end of book 1. It instantly transported me back to how devastated I felt at the end of the first book because of everything that had happened between Isis and Jack.All of the your favorite characters are back in this second installment, plus we get to see a lot more of Sophia. She becomes a main character with secrets of her own. Secrets are the name of the game in the Lovely Vicious series. Everyone has them, I thought we found out most of them in the first book. So not the case! There were lots more coming to the surface in Savage Delight. I didn't see some of them coming at all.I so badly just wanted Isis and Jack to start off where they finally left off near the end of the first book, but they had a long way to go to get back to that. Plus there was the added complication of Sophia. I got the impression through the first book that she only liked Jack as a friend, but I started to see a whole new Sophia in this story. One that I wasn't sure how much I liked. I understand why she was how she was, but my perception of her changed.The Lovely Vicious series is dark and wounded. These characters are so deeply flawed but they are able to find comfort in each other after all of these awful things happened. I loved that they each faced some of their fears in this book. And I loved how they stuck together. The ending was tragic and intense once again and it left us hanging, just like last time. I am so sad that there is only one book left in the trilogy, but I am so anxious to see how everything will wrap up. This is a really unique series. There is not anything quite like it out there that I have encountered. I love it.*Disclaimer- I got a complimentary copy for review in exchange for my honest thoughts.

Tru has had enough and with help from Casper another Defiance member Tru leaves the MC to make a life of her own.Known as the Chaos there is a meteor strike on Earth and terrible storms rage for months on end blocking out all of daylight.  Communications go down and the world changes into one of crime where woman are treated badly and gangs rule.  Tru turns to a rival MC called the Kill Devils for protection and because of Hugh's legacy the leader Padraic takes her in.Tru is safe and fine whilst her father is alive but when news reaches them that he has died Padraic asks to be bonded to Tru.  A woman can't say no to a bonding but Tru does therefore humiliating Padraic. She is returned to Defiance where Padriac demands that the MC rape and murder her or face war. Tru hands her fate to Casper the guy who let her leave Defiance in the first place and he has only days to decide whether Tru is worth going to war for.  The book starts with Tru being dropped off at Defiance by the Kill Devils.I love post apocalyptic books and I love bad ass biker books so imagine how happy I was when a friend of mine recommended Defiance to me.  For the most part I thoroughly enjoyed Defianace but I did have some gripes.I would have liked more detail on the post apocalyptic side of things.  This was a bit light and I didn't get the feeling of desperation and chaos that would ensue such a catastrophe.  So if the post apocalyptic storyline is putting you off reading this book then please don't let it as Defiance reads more as a Contemporary Romance book than anything else.There is quite a bit of abuse towards women both as part of being in a MC and part of the post Chaos world.  There is nothing hugely graphic about it but I did have a bit of an issue with it.I found parts of the book confusing you are thrown straight into this book, hence why I gave my own synopsis to give you a helping hand.  So pay attention when reading as you may miss bits and later on wonder what is happening. I did this and had to backtrack a couple of times.I really liked the characters.

811834,B00I5X4UMS,"[0, 0]",3,"Venkatesh Krish's MY BROTHER THE ALIEN is a cute story for elementary readers.  It focuses on 6th grader Maddy Jenkins who discovers a strange little boy hiding in the feeding shed at the local zoo, eating hay.  They boy's name is Alfear, and he tells Maddy that he hasn't seen his parents in two weeks.  She is determined to take him home with her, and since her father works for social services, that's exactly what happens.  But it doesn't take too long for Maddy to discover that Alfear isn't an ordinary little boy - he has a three foot tongue, which he uses to eat leaves from trees in Maddy's backyard, he's telepathic, and he really looks like a giant lizard (his human form is only a projection he uses to disguise his true self).  In fact, he's an alien, and his parents accidently left him on Earth when they set off on their latest three-year mission.  So the Jenkins family decides to take care of him until his birth parents can return.This is all very interesting, and Alfear is a great character - his reactions to some of the things he encounters with his foster family are quite amusing (he loves Animal Planet (especially Dog Whisperer - he even speaks dog!), bubble baths, and maple leaves, which he says taste a little bit like maple syrup.  But the central conflict in the story - an evil man named Mr. Cooper wants to get his hands on Alfear so he can experiment on him and make a ton of money - doesn't really work.  Mr. Cooper tries to get social services to transfer guardianship of Alfear from the Jenkins family to him, but his wife has been diagnosed with serious depression and his son, Zach, has a reputation as the school bully, so his efforts do not succeed.  This doesn't stop Cooper, of course, and by the end of the novel his efforts to get his hands on Alfear become downright psychopathic.So what begins as a lighthearted children's novel about accepting differences becomes an overwrought thriller about a mad scientist who delights in torturing children and animals.  It's a rather creepy mix, and the novel would have been much more successful had the conflict involved the children rather than a psychotic adult.  Zach Cooper, who is introduced early in the story as a bully who torments Maddy, could easily have become the antagonist here, causing problems for Alfear.  But with Zach's father as the villain, the situation becomes something much more sinister and much more frightening.Additionally, MY BROTHER THE ALIEN needs a good editor.  There are formatting errors that make it difficult to read (line spacing is inconsistent, as is the use of italics to indicate telepathic communication).  Children, especially, might have problems with pages of dense type.  An editor would also catch dialogue formatting errors and awkward phrasing.Bottom line, I really like the premise of this book, and I think the relationship between Alfear and Maddy (and her family) is heartwarming and charming.  But once crazy psycho Mr. Cooper starts stirring up trouble, the story loses its heart and takes an unnecessarily dark turn.  Krish has indicated that there will be future Alfear stories, and I do think there's plenty of room for more adventures starring this cute little alien and his human foster family.  I just hope those future stores are more child-centered and less dependent on evil adults.[Please note:  I was provided a copy of this novel for review the opinions expressed here are my own.]","05 30, 2014",AJNW2SVETWAW1,kacunnin,Cute children's story takes an unnecessarily dark turn,1401408000,0.0,False,3.0

The overall story depicts the life of a young college student who recently lost her mother and brother to what the police have deemed to be an animal attack. The main character Stella gets thrown into the world of all things paranormal when she meets a boy Conner who happens to be a vampire, and another boy Will who happens to be a werewolf. She ends up being torn between the two and has to decide who she wants to be with. Throw in an overbearing father who also happens to be paranormal and a series of unfortunate events and you get Stella's crazy life. She has a lot of ups and downs and quit a few near death experiences. This book was hard to put down! There were parts that were a bit off for me and the language was different since it is more European English and not American English which you notice in the 's' as opposed to 'z' in words like recognize and in references to school when Stella says things likes 'I need to go to University today' or 'I attend University' instead of saying college but it didn't bother me or take away from my ability to enjoy the book. Overall I liked it. I could have used some more story development and the chapter endings were sometimes strange but I'm looking forward to seeing what Jess Watkins puts out next. The ending definitely sets us up for a second book.My Ratings: I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.

965650,B00L5F13V4,"[1, 1]",5,"Dedication from the book-To all the girls in the world:YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.Don8217t let the world tell you otherwise.My CommentsWow, oh wow, how I WISH this book had been available when I was in high school.  However, I8217m utterly grateful to have read it at this point in my adulthood as well.  This story had my full attention from the beginning and I just had to know what happened to Madison 8220Mads.8221  She8217s not your typical teenager, but she suffers way too much emotionally from low self-esteem no matter how many times her best friend, Chase, tells her how amazing she is.  That8217s not surprising though because sometimes an outsider8217s perspective can help tremendously.Enter Zach Taylor, the new kid in school and instantly noticed because he8217s a hunk.  Madison hasn8217t even spoken to him, but she immediately wishes she could catch the attention of a guy like that and believing this to be impossible she starts feeling low again.  So when he seeks her out and pursues her friendship, no one is more surprised than she is at his sudden interest in her.  It8217s just too good to be true!  Instead of allowing herself to hope, she ignores the guy and even convinces herself that it8217s some cruel joke for him to like her.  Little does she know the incredible plan God has for her.Before I even read the story, I noticed the dedication of the book and felt like this story was for me (LOVED the dedication).  I never believed myself to be pretty or knew my worth in high school so when I heard about this book, I knew it was for me.  Any other girls reading this review ever dealt with low self-esteem? We ALL have and I truly believe this book will have a huge impact on the females who pick this up.  It DEFINITELY affected me deeply!Even though Madison is WAY too hard on herself and MOST of the time (even when not being mocked or laughed at) it8217s in her head that something is wrong with her.  She also makes the mistake of comparing herself to ALL the girls around her including her mom, which convinces her further of being inadequate.  She annoyed me a few times in the book about lies she believed and misunderstandings with Chase.  But again, I8217ve been guilty of the same issues.Despite this book being a Christian YA book, I didn8217t see it as preachy at all.  Madison has no idea how much God loves her and once she discovers this reality, it changes everything she knows.  Her heart is already incredible, but she is a slave to thoughts of ugliness and unworthiness.  When a person doesn8217t understand God8217s love for them, this can be a problem.  No matter how much you8217re told how beautiful you are, it8217s a revelation that must come from God or you8217ll never believe it/never understand the truth of it/start to doubt it.It was really cool how the author implemented that doubting God, feeling ugly, feeling worthless, and even depression from those thoughts are part of spiritual warfare.  No matter what others say, only what God says should be important and focused on.  Everyone relates to peer pressure and wanting to fit in, but knowing who you are in Christ is the best way to knowing joy and being free from negative comments from others (even a certain little brother who was  just spiteful throughout the book).It was sooooo easy to hate Ashley8217s character in this book, but we do learn why she8217s so cruel and it makes sense.  Zach is also not who he seems to be, but I really enjoyed his character.  Some of the dialogue from Zach had my eyes go wide more than once.I was able to figure out what was going on from the beginning, but it made the story no less exciting for me as I waited for Madison to overcome her torment.  I also enjoyed how she got a job at a coffee place and her boss was an enhancement to the story.Barnes writes spiritual warfare in such a tangible way, I considered her as talented as Frank Peretti (one of my fave Christian authors and a genius at writing spiritual warfare in fiction).  I thought that God went through so much trouble to get His message across to Madison and to break through to her, I just couldn8217t believe what it took for her to understand.  However, God pursues EACH of us this way and He definitely has spent years working on my heart to understand the same message.  He loves us, He fights for us, He8217s relentless to make us understand who He is, He will never stop, and He8217s determined to show us our worth because even though He8217s already make the ultimate sacrifice, He still goes out of His way to show us how beautiful we are to Him.Madison finally learns this crucial lesson and it changes her in magical ways.  I connected with this story and it was much deeper than I anticipated.  I hurt with Madison, I wanted to stand with her against lies and cruelty, I was happy for her, and I rejoiced for her when she overcame!  What a great book, a definite jewel that shines for God and His beautiful creation82308230US!! :)At the end of the story there are two bonus short stories that I simply loved on top of this great book!!  One is from Zach8217s perspective and one is from Chase8217s perspective, brilliantly done and very special.I want to thank the author from the bottom of my heart for the review copy provided.

When life falls apart for Lynne after not listening to her dreams, is there a way for her to change her life, make it turn around for the better? Are there do overs in life? Are some people meant to be together if society and wrong decisions don't get in the way?Maria Savva has a knack for delivering a story that will both chill you on one level and leave you wondering about the nature of people and life on another.So many times in our lives we proceed through to a goal that deep down we know is wrong. Not only do we not listen to ourselves, we don't listen to our dreams.In Ms. Savva's book, The Dream, we discover aspects of relationships and people, we may not heretofore have seen or thought about. We are taken on a trek into both reality and imagination and left wondering whether they aren't more closely tied then we ever considered.Are dreams only our imagination, do they tell us what our subconscious already knows or are they more? Can they be more? Is there extraordinary things in the universe that can happen to us if we are open and ask? These are questions that Lynne will discover.Ms. Savva has taken on subject matter seldom defined, but many times imagined by many of us.I highly recommend this book.","04 23, 2013",A1F2GEBUAZNOJV,M.

I really enjoyed this book but, so help me, if I have to read about another father being in ICU and dying I'm going to stop reading books (at least for a while). I read while on the treadmill (several hours a day) and I hate crying while I am on the treadmill and it's become a nasty habit with stories like this getting me where it hurts. Anyway, at least that scene didn't dwell for too long (lost my dad last June so it's still raw in my mind). This story revolves around Nathan and Quinn, two lifelong friends. Their fathers grew up together and Nathan and Quinn were born the same year and were friends from birth. They did everything together even losing their virginity to each other BUT (and isn't there always a but) Nathan didn't want to be gay (like he had a choice) and wanted what his (very wealthy) parents had - a nice house, a husband/wife relationship dynamic, children, white picket fence etc. etc. etc. and he knew he could never have it with Quinn (or so he thought). So, on graduation night, after they gave each other their virginity, Nathan ran away.Turns out Nathan joined the Marines, stayed in 4 yrs, married some woman, divorced her, moved back home (when he had gone to the police academy and then offered a position back in TN... Quinn's dad was the town sheriff) and met and married his second wife. He didn't want to take over the family business which was another reason for running away. Quinn, on the other hand, went off to TX to start his music career in roadhouses. He moves to Nashville and becomes successful but, in a bid to forget what he can't be (because he, also, does not want his dad to find out that he's gay) he becomes quite the slut and humps just about anything (human), both men and women... mostly strangers. And he's high most of the time. He also happens to get some addict pregnant. His music's really taking off and he's hit rock bottom. He decides to get help and goes to rehab. His daughter is born. The addict kills herself so he ends up with a daughter who he palms off on a nanny.Quinn's mother died when he was young. She died of mumps complications. Nathan caught mumps off her and ended up sterile. His second gets really pissed off when she finds out Nathan is sterile and divorces him and takes him to the cleaners (gets all his inheritance money). She also happened to have seen Quinn kissing Nathan on their wedding day (not that Nathan reacted because he didn't. He'd wanted his marriage to work out).At the start of the story Quinn's dad has been shot and is dying in ICU. This tale, of two men who really should never have been apart but who really had to be in order to find their ways back to each other and into acceptance of what they wanted and needed, is beautiful. I didn't like the rape scenes (though the rapes weren't described during the time of the crime but as a memory coming back) and the carving and violence were tough to read. Just loved this story and the two men, Nathan in particular. Also liked Nathan's family and the fledgling relationship between his sister and the FBI guy. Wonder what the sequels will bring.

When her daughter is late home one evening, her anxiety is heightened by broadcast news that two prison escapees are on the loose, after a prison officer has been hit over the head and killed. One is a convicted rapist and murderer, the other a fraudster. Her daughter arrives home safely: but one of the escapees also turns up on her doorstep. Which one is he?I have to be honest, the whole thing is just a tad incredible and unlikely, especially as Maria's feelings towards the escapee turn to something quite improbable. The writing is rather `raw' and unrefined, the text is riddled with punctuation errors and omissions, and the dialogue is a bit stilted. I think there's more mileage in the plot which would have made it all a little more believable. And yet, I have to say it's quite an enjoyable story that you can read in just an hour, and Maria's emotional confusion over the situation in which she finds herself is well conveyed.

It's where we meet Allie, who owns Tia Maria's and who is an occasional tow truck driver.Allie, a widowed single mother who juggles all roles in her sons life the best way possible with the help of her Rosa and Rosa's husband Dario. They have been there for Allie before and she has considered them family for many years now. Allie took over her aunt's business and kept the initial idea of service and recipes Tia Maria's was based on from the beginning. The restaurant is a hit and that's exactly the reason why Max Van Buren is on a road trip headed straight there.Max is a successful business man who owns the majority of Van Buren Enterprises with his brothers. Unfortunately for them, the restaurants across the country are not doing quite so well anymore. Max is pretty aware that the real spark of his business came from Abuelito, his great grandfather who came to the United States with an original traditional Mexican recipe. Max is on the verge of losing his position as a CEO if he doesn't find a way to turn his business and return it to what it once was: a real traditional Mexican restaurant.Seeking to achieve his goal, he does some marketing research so he can find the well kept secrets of those successful but small restaurants to which his own chain of restaurants are being compared to. He didn't imagine that his small stop in Primrose would bring him the answers he needed and a woman who turned his world completely upside down. But Max is keeping a secret from Allie, one that could possibly threaten their new found relationship.I won't say more becasue I don't want to spoil it, but THIS IS A MUST great short story! I think the chemistry from the beginning did it for me. Both main characters blended so well and interacted in such a way it simply attracts you effortlessly. Personally, I felt there was enough material to stretch the story a little bit more. Max and Allie had so much to offer! The love scene was beautiful and leaves you wanting more.As a native Southern Californian myself, I can easily picture the memories Max has with his Abuelito and his Taco Truck in Griffith Park. I have been there so many times in my life it's like a breathing living part of my early childhood. Original recipes are a characteristic many of those trucks still have nowadays.I simply enjoyed this book so much. It left me wanting a couple of Tacos de Asada with Pico de Gallo  Tomatillo Sauce myself!","10 13, 2012",A2KSFF4LKIS8JF,My Secret Romance Book Reviews My Secret Rom...,Must READ!!!,1350086400,0.0,False,5.0

Others have commented on the author's attention to detail, and it really is impressive.  Somewhere in the author's home is a wall filled with the logistical mechanics of this book (and the entire series). I don't know how else he could do it. If I were president, I'd hire him for something, because a careful mind like that is hard to come by.That said, the book does not offer everyone everything. The author chose to focus the story on the central character's progress toward his vision in technical, logistical, and political terms.  Friendships are foreground, romances are background--waaay in the back. No complicated relationships here. For me, as an astronomy/space afficionado, it was actually a breath of fresh air, but others may miss it. Also, I appreciate the political climate in the story, which is clearly patterned after our contemporary culture.For the most part, the science is sound, so I didn't mind giving an inch here and there. There are some mechanical issues (punctuation and usage, mostly).  I liked the characters too much to examine them while I was reading, but in retrospect it's safe to say the story was written to include young teens. It may be a bit lean in terms of exploring the human condition, but as a believer in space exploration for its own sake, this book fanned that enthusiasm as nothing else has for at least the last twenty years. It's one of the top five books out of the last hundred or so I've read.

It's a story between two best friends - Liese and Frey, who are starting to acknowledge the real feelings between them. Liese is grieving over the loss of her husband and unborn child through a tragic accident that left her devastated. For 2 years, she's just going through the daily motions of her life like on an autopilot. The story started off with Liese holed up in her house, isolating herself, revisiting the events that happened same time 2 years ago. Frey, being the best friend that he is, came to her rescue and did everything he could to put her mind off of what happened and helped her in overcoming her grief and guilt. Liese has been blaming herself about what happened. Guilt that kept on haunting her preventing her from moving on with her life. Frey, who's been harboring romantic feelings towards her ever since they were 13 years old unknown to Liese. He's just scared of ruining the friendship they have and might push Li farther away from him.At first this story started quite slow for me but as I read further, I began to like how things are going. It's a short read but still enjoyable. I loved that the author wrote some back stories with what happened to Liese on that tragic day and how she and Frey became friends. It really helped me in understanding the characters and made me feel connected to them. I didn't like Li's constant denial of her true feelings towards Frey but I understood from where she was coming from. But still, if I have somebody like Frey around, it won't take me that long to realize that who I really wanted all along is just in front of me. I won't be pushing him away rather pull him towards me. Frey is a wonderful character. He's caring, lovable, loyal and patient. A true friend and someone who could be more than a true friend.All in all, I love this book. It was entertaining though the ending is abrupt and there are some things left unresolved, it was okay since there's another book in the series.

That is, the ingredients are exactly what your mom or grandmother used in her kitchen.  The mixing and cooking techniques are, too.  This is the wholesome stuff.Sure, in the 50s, there were clever things you could add to recipes, but a lot of moms and grandmothers stuck to the healthy, tried-and-true ingredients, and that's what you'll find in this cookbook.  Nothing risky, nothing tricky, nothing super-fancy, and nothing you'll have to search high and low to find.Some recipes take shortcuts. However, they're the same shortcuts that earned nods of approval -- and comments like, Ooh, that's so clever! -- in the 1950s.  For example, the no-bake Lemon Ice Box Pie recipe uses crushed vanilla wafers for the crust, with a little extra set aside for a topping.  Mom would approve.If you want to make healthier desserts than almost anything you can buy at the store, this is the cookbook you're looking for.  And, it's sure to bring smiles and praise like, Wow.

Thanks to Cecilia Gray.)16-year-old Lizzie is a student at the prestigious Jane Austen Academy (Jasta), a school which has been her home for several years. Things are changing this year though as the school has been sold, and it's new owners want to make changes.The first thing to change is the student number - with double the usual number of students attending, the second change is that the new students will be male, drastically changing the atmosphere at the previously all-girl school.Lizzie however is determined to set things right, a goal that she started working on before term even started by writing an inflammatory piece for the student newspaper, basically dissing the new owners and new developments at the school.When Lizzie does arrive to start the new school year, she finds that her room sharing request has not been honoured, and instead of sharing a room with her best friend Ellie, she is sharing a room with Anne, the former school owner's daughter. Complaining to the headmistress about this problem, Lizzie relents and accepts the new living arrangements when the headmistress offers her the opportunity to be the managing editor of the student newspaper, a job that Lizzie has been lusting after.Still more changes are happening at Jasta though, and now Lizzie is on a quest to find out who the new owners are and to talk to them, and to stop the proposed name change of the school. What she doesn't realise is how this crusade of hers will affect her relationship with her best friend Ellie, and her feelings towards the gorgeous Dante, one of the new students at the school who seems to be hiding some secrets of his own.This book is a modern retelling of `Pride and prejudice `. Unfortunately though I haven't read pride and prejudice yet so I'm not sure how alike the two books are! Irregardless of this I enjoyed this book. The main character Lizzie was ridiculously headstrong at times, and made some poor decisions too, but a lot of this was in her quest to become a journalist, so I have to let her off on that one. If she hadn't of made the decisions she did she probably wouldn't have been much of a journalist.The story was paced nicely and well written, and held my attention all the way through. The characters were genuine, and although the storyline did seem to be a bit predictable in places it didn't spoil it for me. Both fortunately and unfortunately, although we got some answers at the end of this book, the story wasn't really finished. Fortunately this means that there must be another book to come, but unfortunately it means that we have to wait to find out the rest of Lizzie's story!Overall - an enjoyable read and I'm looking forward to the next one!7.5 out of 10.(Book length: 2156 Kindle Locations)","09 27, 2012",A3R6PYQRPAZE0K,Sarah,A nice young adult romance circa Pride and Prejudice!,1348704000,0.6666666666666666,True,4.0

If anything, it's made things livelier.  The two rival gangs, the Beach Gang and the Downtown Gang, control the alcohol distribution and the speakeasies.  Jasmine, a society reporter with dreams of being the next Nelly Bly, is enjoying a night out at her half-brother Sammy's  speakeasy, the Oasis, when she witnesses a man's death.  The new Prohibition Agent in town, handsome James Burton, threatens to shut down the Oasis if Sammy does not cooperate with his investigation.  After  Sammy is accused of murder, Jasmine is determined to clear his name.A couple of months ago, I had the pleasure of reviewing Ms. Collier's second book, Bathing Beauties, Booze and Bullets, and enjoyed it. She was kind enough to offer me the opportunity to review the first in the series.  I enjoyed seeing how the characters were introduced.  Jasmine is a wonderful example of a 1920s modern woman who is enjoying the new freedoms available to women and still wanting more.  While she is happy to have landed a job at the local newspaper, she wants to be taken seriously as a reporter.The setting and dialogue are half the fun in this novel.  The descriptions of the speakeasies, dances and the clothing bring the story to life.  The mesh bags, compacts, and perfume lamps sound like great accessories and the 1920s slang is entertaining.

She was so funny and sarcastic and I could easily imagine myself becoming friends with her. Nearly everything she said had me bursting out laughing. She was hilarious! The one thing that I didn't like about her was how she started crying at the slightest thing. Don't get me wrong, she is one tough chick but she was a bit too emotional at times. Another thing that annoyed me was how easily she forgave her friend Amanda when she started going out with a boy she knew Jes liked. I though that was a pretty bitchy thing for a best friend to do and if I was Jes I would have been a bit more angry with Amanda.I also really liked Seth. He was funny and dorky and seemed more real than the usual dark and brooding types that most YA books feature. He was a great love interest as you could easily imagine meeting someone like him in real life. Lily was also a great character. She was spunky and feisty and some of the things she said were just brilliant. Towards the end of the story though I started to feel so sorry for her as I learned more about the things she has faced.The story itself was interesting. Nothing much happened in the beginning but things soon picked up about half way in. The paranormal aspect of the book really held my interest. I haven't read any books centered around these creatures. I was actually surprised when I found out what they were so that piqued my interest more. The romance was so much more believable than other books. There was none of the instant love that is in about 90% of YA books. I loved that about this book. I am a big romantic but there are only so many instant-love stories that I can read before it gets dull. A thing that was never explained though was the dreams that Jes was having of the fire and brimstone. I have a theory but hopefully things will be explained in book 2.Overall a great edgy read with witty characters, snappy dialogue and some great action scenes.

They connect instantly and begin their affair. Alistair is a Dom at heart and he wants Keturah as his submissive. They work through her issues with his desires to try to establish their relationship however, Alistair has secrets. Lots of them.Mae and Sam are in love, and have been for a while. They also have a secret that will set off a chain of events that will forever change Keturah and Alistair's lives. As a result of lies told by Mae, Sam, and Alistair, Keturah runs from the pain they've caused her. Keturah has no one and has to start over by herself.Alistair and Keturah meet again when she's in love with a wonderful man, but tragedy strikes. Alistair is at her side forcing his way in her life and she has troubling decisions to make about her relationship with him. A series of truths are revealed and we are shown just who Keturah can trust.The conclusion has a happily ever after with a bit of pain and closure added because of the tragedy.Pros:Well written.Plot flows.Keturah is likable.Keturah was strong and a realistic character. No pushover.Alistair's story is unique.BDSM if it's your cup of tea.No cliffhanger!!!I liked Richard's character. I felt they were real. I felt their passion more than Alistair and Keturah. I liked the back and forth between Richard and Keturah, it was sexy.Absolutely loved that Keturah wore braids, had breasts, hips and brown skin!!!!!!!The political angle with energy bill was well thought out and realistic.Cons:I just didn't wholeheartedly feel the love connection between Alistair and Keturah. I know I'm the odd man out, but I'm being honest. Their love scenes were okay.Not a fan of BDSM.

The father had a garden where golden apples grew. One night, the apples started disappearing. The father ordered his sons to catch the thief. The oldest son stood guard the first night, but fell asleep and did not see the thief. Etc. etc etc.And turns it into this:Are you ready for a little adventure? If you are, you can go in.Rule One: Come back as soon as you get the feather.Rule Two: Don't talk to old ladies. They can be dangerous.There's also a little hint of The Chronicles of Narnia in this book, which would make kids relate to the story much more readily and some humor for a good chuckle:...we got a little lost.And now you may get a little eaten!!And also some potent imagery, sometimes colorful, sometimes spooky:The bird was more colorful than any bird Alex had ever seen. Its feathers were bright red, orange, and yellow. The tail was blue with some purple.Right behind the woman was a fence. It was made from tall wooden poles. On top of each pole sat a human skull.

Aunt Dwill happens to be the keeper of the local lighthouse and Daphne is there to help her with the upkeep when she meets Zach. Zach is a Native American who is a member of the local Micmac tribe and Daphne is immediately taken with him. They begin working together on sprucing up the 200 year old cemetery by the lighthouse when Daphne begins experiencing some odd visions and nightmares involving ghosts. When Daphne and Zach begin to research and figure out why Daphne is experiencing such things, they realize the reason is closer to home for both of them than they imagined.Underneath all of the visions Daphne is experiencing, there is a romance blooming between Daphne and Zach. They are really sweet together and I really enjoyed reading about the two of them getting to know each other. I especially loved how Daphne was so interested in Zach's culture and getting to know his family. I also really loved Aunt Dwill and Zach's dad, Jay.

I love books that can incorporate music into the story and this book does just that with an interesting approach.Casey Barnes loves music and she creates these playlists for her fellow classmates. She also plays music and dreams of being a rock legend. Casey is a girl I would have liked to be friends with in high school. She has great taste in music and she is a fun character. I wish she could make me a playlist. She isn't a major troublemaker but she has her moments too. Overall Casey is realistic because she makes mistakes. She develops well throughout the book. There are several other great characters. I especially loved getting to know Ben, Yull, and Leigh.I was easily hooked by this story within the first few pages. However then I found that the pacing was okay. Some moments slowed down a bit while other moments went too quickly. The characters were still developed well though. I finished this book rather quickly because I cared about these characters.This story was also realistic about high school. Casey and her friends are growing up. There are several topics that teens experience that are brought up in this book such as sex. Then there is the relationship that Casey shared with her ex-boyfriend. There are plenty of guys like Alex out there. Overall I really enjoyed Casey Barnes Eponymous and I definitely recommend this to any music lovers!*A copy of this book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review","11 23, 2012",A1PFZXZMCXURF6,Traci The Reading Geek,An Enjoyable Story,1353628800,0.0,False,4.0

The clues lead to a vampire kill.  The only attacks that ever come to this close to brutal...were Dracula's.  Vlad Dracula went to ground two years ago after involvement in Sebille's Killing spree, where Nate and Tess were involved.  Now, they are afraid he might be back and looking to make Tess his once and for all.  Tess, even in her condition, is ready to go after Dracula and settle her score with him.  Then, there's a hero (or vigilante) who's been swooping in and taking care of bad guys, and strange vampires, they are calling The Spider.  The human governed group, The Agency, is involved and keeps appearing everywhere Trish looks for clues to the vampires on a killing spree, creating more complications the Trish could ever imagine.We meet Trish in the Prelude, her memory of being transplanted from Make Believe to Here and Now.  When she first met the rueful Nicky Blue, and even felt the draw to him then.  Again, Kate uses Preludes with ease.  I love them in this series.  They are a memory of coming to Here and Now, reminding us of where the Tales came from.  You get a great feel of their tale and history.Saved from an attack and being pushed out of her apartment due to a haunting, Trish finds Nicky who's come asking for help.  No where else to go, Nicky takes her with him to keep safe, at his home. Trish is excited to be with the one she's had a heart for, yet trying to contain herself and not get over hopeful. The history we learn of Trish's and Nicky's. Wow. They are a set. And what Trish saw when she looked into Juliette's dead eyes before Grimm took her soul to rest, yea we learn that. Wow. Honestly, I was wondering how Kate was going to bring our newest couple together, knowing he's still hurting in some ways after his wife's death. And Kate set the foundation right away, and grew that strong brick building to create a lovely home for a new couple.Aaah, The Agency.  This is a neat little agency.  They are like the Men in Black crossed with CIA.  Top secret, yet they have their noses in too many things Tale.  And even are strong arming Trish's place of business, the FMA - Fairytale Management Authority.  But Trish also has a sorted history with one of the Agents as well.We see old friends and couples again.  Tess has been trying to pair her friends up, wanting them to be happy like her.  Tess is also having troubles, and they fear it's due to the condition of her mans past.  But this is a small drop in the bucket of troubles Trish is seeing and dealing with.  We see Lavender and Seth as they come to visit everyone, and get to help.  Oh Lavender and her dysfunctional family dinner. LOL! Seth is still hot as ever. And they are happy as ever. Gideon! He is so sweet! I love him with his brief appearances here. Then we have new characters. Rumpelstiltskin, Oh my goodness! LOL! Loved him and Truman. Make me smile.The mystery murder story takes off and builds, dropping hints with each turn. There is a twist to the story, and I loved the way Kate turned this. I was not expecting the end with this mystery and string of dead bodies. Action packed with Nicky and Trish. Nicky has a gangster feel to his methods and tricks, but he's a strong individual as well. Nicky and his easy ways, finds him flirting with Trish and Trish trying to not fall to hard as he's leaving after he takes care of his target. I could see how over the last few years Tess has worn off on Trish. I didn't know if she'd be as kick butt as Tess, but she sure was, and on the sensitive side more than Tess too. Trish is her own person and growing as a character now that we read from her eyes. There is an independence found in Trish like Tess, a strong-ness to do what she needs to do to solve and stop the murders.This is an amazing tale of Romance and Mystery. Once again, Kate has blended the two with amazing talent, in a new and rich world full of possibilities.","08 25, 2013",A1XOYBQ8X25P8M,MelHay,"Oh Sweet nib-lets! Nicky Blue is back and fighting.

386807,B00AQS6ZAK,"[0, 0]",5,"Mark Butler gives us an excellent but short look at The Fourth Crusade that was to bring Christian Knights on a path to deliver Jerusalem from the grips of Islam and return it to the Christians.. The problem was that the Fourth Crusade got bogged down in the Christians attacking other Christians in hopes of acquiring enough cash to fund the Crusade.  It was accomplished by one deposed King who convinced the Crusaders to go and defeat Constantinoble and return that Kingdom to his right, in exchange for the money needed for the Crusade to Jerusalem.The problem that they ran into was that the battles they fought were bloody, tiresome and although they did overthrow Constantinoble they were not able to recover the riches of that city which had been plundered already by the false King.Mark Butler writes the historical account of the Crusade through the eyes of a fictitious family, that's what gives us a historical novel..  The family is the family of a warrior named Rayjo who was a hero of the Third Crusade.  He has three children, Juno, Ruggiero and Maria.The opening of the novel is written from Ruggerios perspective as he is attempting to return from the Crusade to report to King Peter of Spain the atrocities that he has witnessed.  He is a Priest of the Catholic Church who was sent out with the armies to participate in the Crusade, since it was a religious and Holy war.From this point Butler uses flashbacks of Ruggerios to his childhood to help us learn about his family and the circumstances that brought them to the point where Rayjo and Juan are warriors headed off to war and Ruggerios joins them as a Priest who goes along to care for the warriors.We will learn about the Crusade through Ruggerios eyes as he processes what is going on and why the Crusade goes the wrong direction and brings pain and suffering to the Christians involved.The character development is good, you come to know the hearts and thoughts of Rayjo, Juan and Ruggerio.  You come to see how power and greed often drive the warriors instead of a sense of calling to right a religious wrong.  The story is well written, it will hold your attention and you will find yourself cheering for the good guys and booing the bad guys and often wondering who is good and who is bad.Butler brings history to life in this well written short chronicle of one family and their dealings with the Fourth Crusade.Enjoy!","06 10, 2013",A1C74SFQ5UMHLS,William D.

While the plot is one that I have seen done many times before, there's something about good writing that makes you not care! Maybe I was just in one of my steamy romance phases where any decently described sex scene sounded terrific to me. For a while it seemed as though I was getting a hold of books that had a few men on base but never knocked one out of the park. Ya know? Either the situations were poorly written or the scenes laughable. But Rian has a good one here!As I said, it's not the most original plot line. (When someone finds something completely in its own world and shockingly new, would you please pass it to me??) Both Jake and Ivy have some issues to resolve, and of course emotional scarring brings them closer. The characters could have used a little bit more developing. I'm still not totally sure why Ivy was so held up about her sister. That problem wasn't conveyed very well. However, the way the sexual tension plays out in the book...Whew! I also enjoyed it because the girl has a backbone on her! As I'm sure I've said (and will say) countless times, I'm not into the whole damsel in distress plots. While they do have a time and a place (after all, everyone needs help at some point), I like my characters to at least be able to think on their own. A peeve of mine when the character constantly over analyzes every small detail in their life. Sometimes you just have to go with it and not really think about it. Let your inhibitions run wild!

I began reading Josh's Ocean with the same anticipation only to be sorely disappointed.  This has to be one of the most annoying, cheesy books I've read in a long time.I'm sure I understand what the author was trying to convey hope among adversity, forgiveness and believing in God, the love of family and the value of friendship.  I'm sure this is what this was all about, but I couldn't enjoy the message because it was preachy, shallow and trite.  A major, unbelievable happy ending with words of wisdom from a child.  Ah......come on really?I didn't enjoy this book at all.  Although I finished it I was skip-reading after awhile just to hurry to get to the end so I cannot rate this book well.

I happened to have have THE MISBEHAVING MARQUESS for the Kindle already, most likely the result of a free day on Amazon. (Maybe this is perma-free? I don't know.)Anyway, I opened the book up to take a peek and wound up reading the entire story in one sitting. It's a short but satisfying read. I really liked the heroine, Cat, who is intelligent and strong willed in addition to being charitable and compassionate. She has endured the five year absence of her husband, Jamie with remarkable fortitude. Their separation winds up being the product of a misunderstanding and stupid male vanity.  Allegedly, he cites needing an heir as the reason for returning to his marital home but it soon becomes clear that he has finally gotten over his wounded pride.My issue with Regencies is that the heroes are invariably arrogant asses. Jamie, the prodigal husband, starts out no different, but at least he is contrite and apologetic by story's end. I enjoyed the humorous elements of the story involving goats stealing clothing.The majority of conflict is internal, the product of the five year old fight between the married couple, and revolves around their efforts to forgive one another. There's a bit of external conflict thrown in toward the climax but I'd have liked more consistency throughout. (The fire felt thrown in.) Love scenes are sensuous and heartfelt. The author accomplished a lot in a very short page count. The writing is well above average and I'm confident fans of the genre will adore this novella.","01 21, 2014",A2NTZ9HDGJHK4I,Melissa Snark Melissa,Love the purple dress,1390262400,1.0,True,4.0

Menage A'Quatre not a Menage A'Trois.NECROMANCER: 4 stars This is a better story than Bitten. In Bitten there were some areas that felt rushed. Here, the pace is more casual. The romance between the heroine and the two vampires is much better developed for one, the second vampire actually gets a romance instead of just lusting after the heroine.DIARY OF AN INCUBUS: Okay. So far there is so much cliche, and moments when I want to slap the back of the heroine's head that it makes me wonder if my Slytherin tendencies are making me a little too perspicacious. I think I am having a hard time suspending belief in this story.And, ALUCARD???!!! Come on!Last update: I have decided that my earlier scoffing at Alucard's name was premature. The author, in the words of her heroine, cleverly makes note of the trite name, and it is Alucard who jests with Jane as she realises his taking of such a name is hiding in plain site. Alucard, as most know, has been in movies and games, and other novels for years.All in all, the stories are each well-written. Although, I have to admit that ruffled shirts open to the waist annoyed me. ALL the vampires were described as looking like romance book cover pirates.

She's a master in taking and keeping the reader hooked! Believe me when I said that one book isn't enough!I was eager to learn what happened to Drake and everything that's implying Jes and her daughter. I was so into their story that I didn't bother the other characters, but when I started to read Burned in Shadows, I soon discovered that Bells and the twins (Roy and Ronin) were also really intriguing!OMG, the description of the scene between Bells, Roy and Ronin were phenomenal, I can't find a better word to express my total satisfaction toward the talented and imaginative Tigris Eden. I was totally drooling while reading the first sex scene between the trio and I had to ask myself how the author knew what I liked in this field. She knew all my weakness and I couldn't believe I was reading one of these perfect sexy scenes.I'm not used to read about threesome, but Tigris Eden has a fine way to introduce this aspect and it fits well in this story. I didn't think I would love Bells story (because I was so into Drake and Jes) but in fact, I felt compelled by her strong nature and devotion to the twins and her own community.I really appreciated the action surrounding the mysterious Mr. Black and Drake destiny. The fact that Jes has develop new abilities is awesome give her a bigger statue in the gang.This series is a must if you love paranormal romance and if you want to try something new that will spice up your night, Burned in Shadows is part of one of the best series I had the chance to read!","11 8, 2013",A3310VJ3ZMZG93,Proserpine,So hot!!!

My major complain, would be the ending, as I personally don't believe they were ready for that step yet. Especially with Griffin's previous predilections, I see them being able to fall in love, but they aren't in love yet. A couple ice cream cones and a trip to Spain doesn't change Griffin being a prat and Maylee being ... well Maylee. It felt rushed and out of place. I would have preferred to see them taking a step to get to know each other in NYC, where their real lives are, as most of this story is set in Belissime.Griffin was every bit the pretentious snob that he is and I am happy that even in the end, that didn't change. I enjoyed his English lessons as well as his banter and dislike for Gretchen. They are a brotherhood, but readers of this series are well aware that there are mini groups within, so for the first time, we got some insight and good enough conversation from Jonathan.Maylee is country! There is no two ways about it. She is full of everything that makes a Southern country bumpkin. She has the walk, talk, wardrobe and even the outlook on life. I was just as appalled as Griffin, because I keep thinking that Maylee has been in NYC a while now. I didn't dislike her character, but I wasn't a fan of her hang ups either. I learn to tolerate it, but I never got over it. She seemed more suited in Alabama than she did NYC, but what I like, is when she stands up for herself and not only give us a confident side, but allow us to see just how incompetent Griffin is in taking care of himself.The banters were hilarious and there was good conversation, as Jessica continues to find the best females to complement this group of playboy Billionaires. She also kept her theme of isolation until the couple is ready to face the world together, this time, it was all the way in Belissime.I am going to assume that this country is fictional, because I am unable to find it on a map, Google or otherwise, but I liked the culture and details placed in helping us to experience this country through the eyes of both Griffin and Maylee.The sex, when it finally happened, wasn't off the charts hot, but it was more than I expected from Griffin. To be honest, I thought he'd either be gay or a virgin o.OEven though we got the scholar, Maylee helped us to see the tatted rebel who can be unleashed. She got me to see Griffin as more than novels and digging up old ruins. We got to spend time with the Scholar and the relaxed Viscount of the group, as he went on an European adventure with his ditsy, borrowed assistant. It was full of laughs, fun, culture, new experiences and a few country home remedies ... burn talker? Really?-_-It's a short one sitting read with English lessons as you go. No one has yet to beat Hunter and Gretchen's book in this series, but Jessica Clare continues to give us satisfying, compatible romance stories from this series. It highlighted both characters personalities while allowing us to understand and accept them as a couple.P.S. ... It's probably not gonna happen and too late anyways, but I would have sworn one of them would have been gay ... oh well!","04 22, 2014",A64NGKLPWCG32,Kmac,Wasn't that big a fan of Maylee but love the personality of Griffin,1398124800,0.0,True,3.0

I admit that I'm not typically a military book reader, but this book was a really great blend of paranormal, military, romance, action, and mythology.  I never thought I'd admit to loving a story that involves so much Beowulf after being forced to read it in school, but this book was just so unique!I was worried, but, yes, this book takes place in present day.  Seeing the word Viking in the series title always makes me think it's a historical read, so I figured that was worth a mention.  It begins in Afghanistan with an army doctor and a special forces operative.  Theresa is a Jersey girl (Jersey represent!) on the run from her connected family.  Wulf has a lot more secrets than that and is forced to deal with a doctor poking her nose into his past.  Being immortal, while beneficial in the field, is a little big harder to cover up when you get air lifted in as a wounded officer.This was a great forbidden romance tale that sizzled off the pages.  Because Theresa outranks Wulf, their relationship is off limits as far as the army is concerned.  But don't worry, that's not the only story going on in this book.  Aside from immortality and forbidden love, we've also got illegal smuggling, corruption in government, mob bosses, and forced research test subjects going on as well.  This isn't just your typical quick and fluffy paranormal romance read.  It is a very well developed and wonderfully written start to the world of Immortal Vikings.

The stories revolve around the common theme of a necklace found in various compromising situations - usually murder.I finished the anthology in a few sittings. About 99% of the stories were interesting to read and kept my attention.

I was instantly wrapped up in the story and loved the twisted, very wrong, but very right in a very wrong way (haha!), ending.One of the stories I simply skipped through because due to the violent, abusive nature of the repulsive main character (The Trophy Wife by Killion Slade).

She has always had maids and has never had to take care of herself or perform simple household chores. She did however survive a terrifying, brutal mining disaster that left her with nightmares. Her wealthy father has hired a ruthless team of mercenaries to protect Emmaline as she is now his most valuable asset. Emmaline doesn8217t know it yet but her father has agreed to sell her to a known sex trafficker in satisfaction of all of his debts.Emmaline became smitten with the head 8216bad boy8217 mercenary, Pierce Taggert, as soon as she saw him. He is a ruggedly handsome ex-Lawman with a confident swagger, a foul mouth and oozing sexuality.Pierce and his men face an unexpected attack and the clues lead back to a double cross by Emmaline8217s Father. Pierce takes Emmaline into hiding as he tries to figure out what to do - first to protect her and then what to do with her! He8217d like to treat Emmaline as just another paycheck but there is something about her fresh, naive trust and her willing determination to survive that makes him pause. He remembers another young lady who followed his example working in mechanics and war service. He wasn8217t there to save her and the loss has left an emptiness filled only with his guilt. Perhaps he can redeem himself by saving Emmaline from those who would use her, including her father.This is a quick, fast-paced story with action from beginning to end. The setting isn8217t completely fleshed out although there is enough to keep it interesting. The strength of the story is in the characters who are likeable and grab your attention, the action packed plot and the vulnerable romance. The strong combination outweighed the bad language and I enjoyed the story reading through it in practically one sitting. I would be interested in trying other works by Ms. Grant.

Book started out great, introducing main characters with multiple points of view against backdrop of aliens arriving on Mars.  Author does a good job of creating tension on whether aliens are friends or foes before settling the issue.  I did feel that some parts of the story were rushed as the author seemed to have one or two too many balls in the air at once.  Story still flowed well but the terrorist storyline, in particular, seemed to develop slowly then rush to a few spectacular scenes without fully concluding the storyline.There are some minor spoilers in this paragraph but nothing that is more than a few chapters into the book.  Setting is the near future, starting in year 2016, and opens with the aliens arriving at Mars Colony.  Earth mobilizes for hostile aliens while hoping for friendly aliens.  There were many interesting details on societal impacts that arise from cost to mobilize.  It seemed a stretch to me that the UN becomes a powerful central player in this story while it may be the most logical venue for global coordination, it was a little difficult to accept that UN becomes this effective.  Overall this was a good story which I enjoyed.The Black Ships is a standalone novel albeit with a conclusion which begs for a sequel.  Author's website indicates that a sequel is anticipated this summer (March 27th,2012 reply to a fan comment).  There is also a novella published,Metamorphosis (The Black Ships), in the same universe.No major editing issues were noticed. The Black Ships is 5,574 Kindle locations long. Standard length novels seem to run in the 4,500 to 7,000 plus Kindle location range.

At 52% a major plot line resolves, and while the overall evil is still around, the book could have easily finished up at this point, and the rest of the overarching plot could have been resolved in a second book.There's quite a lot of decent action, and the bad guys are suitably bad. I think the good guys could have been a bit more competent, or at least have more than one or two people who could actually do anything. I realize we want the heroes to appear properly heroic, but I felt at time that the population was so lacking that they almost deserved to get slaughtered. The trials that the main hero and heroine undergo are impressively trying though, so that was nice.I'd actually call this a 3.5 star rating. It's good enough that I will be reading the sequel, but as it is also over 600 pages, it will have to wait until I'm up for something that long.","05 25, 2014",A32MYJS69VIO2S,Maraich,Bad Guys Shine in Their Villainy,1400976000,0.0,False,3.0

The first stop on his odyssey is the village bonfire celebrating Midsummer's Eve, where he encounters his classmate, Steph. Much to Jack's surprise, Steph can see Puck, for on this particular evening, the veil between the Fairie World and World of Men is thinnest.Steph shelters him for the night, but he is clearly still in danger.

The theme is May/December, although some are more December/December, but at least one character is over 40-years-old, which is a wonderful change from all the young bucks we normally find in a lot of M/M books.As with any anthology, there were stories I loved, stories I liked, and a few that just weren't my cup of tea. But since I cannot review fifteen separate stories, I am going to pick my top four from the book, in order by rating.Granddad's Cup of Tea by Amy Durreson - 5 starsA wonderful story about two elderly men finding love again after losing their spouses. Ewan and Alex are in their sixties and each has lead a full life. Ewan lives with his daughter and grandchildren, and Alex just lost his lover of many years. When Ewan helps his grandson deliver newspapers, the two men become friends, and it grows into more. A perfect, slow-building sort-of GFY story that shows that love knows no age boundaries.Straight Shooting by Maggie Lee - 4.5 starsCops. Guns. Friend-With-Benefits. Everything I like in my M/M books. The sex was off-the-charts hot, and the combination that one protagonist was the other one's gun range supervisor made the illicit nature of their relationship even steamier. The author made shooting guns sexy.The Bodyguard's Dilemma by Chris Scully - 4.25 starsLogan is a 45-year-old bodyguard who is in love with a much younger, former porn star named Tyler. Now Tyler used to be a client, but after the job was done, the two men remained friends. Even though I think the age difference and Tyler's former profession might be an issue if these two continued their relationship, I loved the chemistry between them and the hope that their love story would have a happy ending.Hunting Season by AC Valentine - 4 starsCity boy inherits his aunt's house in the country and when it needs repairs hires the local handyman to do the work. Immediate attraction ensues. Maybe I have a fixation on shifters and handymen? Because even though geeky guy falls for hard-working blue collar has been done before, I adored this story!To conclude, a lovely anthology that brought tears to my eyes in some instances and in others, made me fan myself as my Kindle exploded from the hotness.

Some are boring and some say the same thing except recycled in a different way. When I began reading Mind Over Mouth I felt as if I was walking down the street with a good friend who was just giving me real, honest-to-goodness, advice on what worked for her. The author does a great job in writing conversationally, as if she were standing face-to-face with the reader.Another thing I liked about this book was that the tips were not something I've heard a zillion times. Even the first tip is something I had never heard of before and they were all very unique. This book would be a perfect book for ALL fitness trainers or coaches to give their clients. It would also be good for anyone who has made some life adjustments that have led to noticeable weight gain. For me, I just had twins last year so these tips are useful to keep me from overindulging. I think pregnant women could benefit, as well since the temptation to overeat during pregnancy is strong and there is nothing in this book that would be dangerous or harmful to a healthy diet while pregnant.Finally, aside from the tips (which are very easy to read and won't take up your whole day), I like the nice chart that the author made. It's easy enough to print out and hang on my fridge. That alone is a great reminder of the mind being stronger than the temptation of opening the cupboards, refrigerator or running down to the store to grab a quick snack.I think anyone who is a snacker or who simply likes to eat too much, or who has bad habits (like me) will like this book.","09 5, 2012",ATL688XQY5781,Anne Violette,It's like a friend is giving the skinny on weight loss advice,1346803200,1.0,True,5.0

One sentence that caught me is, Time to end this... this sentence describe the action that the main character is trying to win her opponent. The author displayed great skills describing fighting scenes. A thumbs up for me, being a paranormal romance author.This novel has a futuristic dystopian setting and the story is surrounding the main lady character named Raine. If you like The Hunger Games, Divergent, you will sure like this novel. There is a lot of girl power especially the part where Raine is having a sword fighting session with Wolfe.The main character is Raine. She is a very strong female character with exceptional sword-fighting skills. She was also an anomaly, an exception to the rule of stability in the Outer Rims. Though she is a young woman, she knows her rights and needs. Raine also likes Jem another male character that has a stout physique. Although, Raine was forced into a new life, and later on was asked to lead. There are lots of surprises and twists install for the reader. I enjoyed this character truly.I also found out that Raine has an uncanny ability to observe what is happening around her and used it to her advantage to help her friends. The plot is simple to follow and is suitable to most people, even young adults. There are some scenes that really caught me by surprise. Rest assured that if you think you aren't able to identify who are the good and bad guys, think again.This is my first time reading Tani Mura - Kindreds Series. As mentioned, this book is great for teens, young adults, and even mature readers like myself. If you like dystopian thriller like this one, you'll definitely get lots of entertainment and enjoyment out of this novel series.If there's one thing I'd change about this book, it would be to create more dialogues between the three friends, Raine, Jem, and Leif.

Thirteen year old children, no matter how magically talented they are, don't say do not instead of don't when they are talking to each other. Also, the author spent a considerable amount of time through one particular character to stress that the two kids who are the focal point of the story-line, remain loyal to each other and not keep secrets. Yet, there is no connection in their thoughts and actions about not keeping secrets, which they continue to do. I understand this is a storytelling technique to create tension, etc., however, the way it's written is clumsy.

81236,B0056GR740,"[2, 2]",5,"A short, sensual and seductive read about a married couple (practically still newlyweds) that is still holding back their passion for one another and it all starts to come together with a simple lesson to waltz. I found the journey they completed very endearing and was not able to stop turning the pages until there were no more to turn. It's a completely satisfying read for a novella.Colin adores his wife Sara and wants to show her as much in a multitude of ways. But what he is thinking is considered to be animal lust and is not an acceptable way to treat a lady. Something of his past brings him to these conclusions (that his desire to show his wife his full passion is not the right way) and he constantly holds back and limits his time with her in a most painful way (painful for himself that is).Sara does not understand why her husband distances himself from her. She only wants to please him and have a very happy and successful marriage. He limits his visits to her bedroom and it's hurtful to her, especially since they are still considered to be a newly married couple. There should be more visits and a lot more passion between them. Attempting to overcome her shyness and tempt her husband to visit her bedroom more frequently leads to private dance lessons and more in the arms of her Colin.I absolutely adored Colin and Sara. Their situation was so real and was a delightful to experience seeing a successful and extremely loving way between husband and wife. I'd say their relationship and person grew right before my very eyes. Light BDSM is within the story and I feel it added an amazingly erotic touch to their relationship. This is a book I plan to reread in the near future and strongly recommend this novella to any readers wanting to enjoy a short, passionate, erotic romance that will put a smile on your face.What happens in a couple's bedroom stays in said couple's bedroom )","08 8, 2012",A3MPS0JFU9NKO3,DragonRene ~AVA~,Waltz of Seduction,1344384000,1.0,True,5.0

Serenading Stanley is exactly that, even in this order.Stanley moves into a building called Belladonna Arms. At the age of 22 he wants, really wants to escape his admittingly crazy, chainsmoking mother. So it doesn't matter that to get to his rooms he has six stairs to climb. And a house full of gays is actually freedom at it's best. Nobody will mind the awkward and unremarkable gay guy...so he thinks. Now this book delivers a typical John Inman trait: His side characters are an amount of originals and described in all their uniqueness. You can't help but to love and adore them.In this building Stanley also meets Roger, the most beautiful man in- and outside he's ever met. And because Stanley has a huge problem with his self eseteem he doesn't even see or realize all the cute and sometimes even shy attempts Roger makes to get to know him better. He can't believe someone as godlike as his downstairs neighbor could be intersted in him.Circumstances (and a mysterious batch of brownies) throw them together and after a looooot of doubt and insecurity mostly on Stanley's side they become a couple. And that's the moment where it gets really sweet, there are masses of adoring glances, looks, confessions of love, etc. If you aren't in the mood for that it might be a bit too much, it gets close to sappy, but only close because it wouldn't be a John Inman book if there weren't still bits of funny and unexpected humor thrown in between.John Inman has a very unique sense of humor. I asuume you either love it or don't understand it. It's has some comical quality I've never experienced with another writer. Humor yes, but not this kind. Personally I adore it, seriously, who else lets a overweight, hairy drag queen faint after climbing (or better...getting dragged by a possible tenant) six stairs? Or writes stuff like: ...and weighed one hundred thirty pounds with a hard-on. Oddly, without a hard-on he still weighed one hundred thirty pounds. You'd think you'd weigh less, wouldn't you?Additionally I love that, even when he writes very romantic parts, his language stays clear, not a hint of too flowery expressions.Yes, I admit, John Inman is one of my favorite authors and I love what he writes. Why? Because it makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me shake my head and it makes me sigh.Well done, thank you John for another great and entertaining reading experience.","10 21, 2013",A27TDWGKZVUE6,Sunne,Probably my favorite John Inman book,1382313600,1.0,True,5.0

You see, Chancie owned Screening Services, and Micah, for his job, had to go get tested.Right away they both felt an incredible yet surprising attraction, so what did they do? They quickly began dating.. and when I say quickly, I mean like that same night. Due to Micah's work schedule, their dates had to be past midnight. You'd think they'd have sex right off the bat, especially with their dates being so late.. but no. Micah, even though he wanted nothing more than to get Chancie in his bed, he let her set the pace for their new relationship.I'm killing myself to hold back, only because of you. Because you're so damned important to me. I don't want to make a mistake.I just want you so muchI was really rooting for Chancie and Micah. They both came from broken marriages, so I felt like they deserved to be in a happy relationship for once.  But no.. it couldn't be that simple now, could it? Chancie's son, Jamie was one tough ten year old boy. I did not know kids that age could be so damn mean and just spiteful!!! But Jamie? He sure got that down.. He made no mistake in letting Chancie and Micah know he did NOT approve of their relationship... and that he pretty much hated Micah.The fact that Chancie spent so much time on the road doing job-related things, her mother-son relationship had already been strained since the beginning and adding Micah to the equation just made things worse.She was almost bankrupt in more ways than one.That quote right there explains it perfectly, really. Every thing seemed to be falling apart. From her job, to her family, to her relationship. Chancie had finally found someone to be truly happy with, but Jamie stood in the way of that. Of course, there's a reason behind Jamie's troublesome attitude.. which kinda broke my heart. But still, he was one huge pain in the...!I don't know where we stood. You and me, especially after the other night. So I didn't talk much about the future.Maybe it's time to face the fact that we don't have a future, Chancie.Micah, obviously had his reservations towards his relationship with Chancie because of Jamie. He'd already suffered through one divorce, so why go through all the pain again? As Micah saw it, she'd never choose him over her son.. not that he'd ever ask her to.Like I said, I was really rooting for Micah and Chancie, so seeing how things kept getting in their way, made me kinda antsy.I really liked the ending, though I wish the Epilogue would've been a tad longer.  I felt like it was a bit too summarized. It just mentioned certain important things in their lives which I really would've loved to read more about.Overall, I liked Christi Williams' writing style.. her book just had a smooth and natural flow.

So she stays home and works at a grocery story.  While this is classified as a NA novel, I think I might put it more into the YA category.  At first, I have to admit that I wasn't too keen on Ava.  She was whiny and scared of her own shadow.  I kept waiting for some sort of explanation about a possible tragic event that would cause her to be so skiddish, but that's just her personality.  By the end of the novel I had warmed up to her though.  This novel is very wordy and carries a lot of (sort of) unnecessary explanation.  There were times I felt like we were just being information dumped on, but none of the important questions were being answered.  Perhaps in subsequent books all that information will be handy.

893858,B00JLUH7Y2,"[0, 0]",5,"I thoroughly enjoyed a A Reason To Stay which has set the standard for another great series by RJ Scott.There are a couple of elements to this story.Firstly, it is a mystery. Something strange is happening up the mountain and Viktor, Navy SEAL, is going to find out exactly what it is and why his nephew ended up in a coma in hospital. His family is at risk and he will do everything and anything to protect them.It is a romance, a story of second and third chances. Viktor and Aiden (who is now working in law enforcement) knew each other in high school, where Aiden had long term expectations. Years later when they reconnect, he still loves Viktor. But Viktor is a man haunted by his belief that as a SEAL he can't offer anything to anyone. He runs. It takes the threat to his family to bring Viktor and Aiden together again as they put their lives at risk to solve the mystery.This is a story with lots of drama and action8211 murder, villains and true hero moments8211 but also soul searching as Aiden and Viktor fight their attraction to each other. The sex is super hot and the ending fabulous8211 i just love big moments that make people face the truth!I enjoyed the blend of mystery and romance and the pacing of the book. Sure, at moments Viktor annoyed the hell out of me but the happy ending for these heroes was definitely worth it.I am now very much looking forward to the second book, Last Marine Standing, due to be released in June, which gives us Sam's story.","05 17, 2014",AJROLS3AD3OLL,Because Two Men Are Better Than One!

In fear for her life and the safety of her loved ones, she agrees to go into a modified witness protection program - finding herself in a house where her protectors, Ryder and Nate, are hot, hunky and exuding so much sex appeal that she doesn't know which will be the source of her downfall, the killer or the stifling pheromones oozing from the pores of her protectors.While Nate plays good cop offering the comfort and sweetness she craves, Ryder is the bad boy who shocks her with his kinky dominant persona and oh-so-wicked ways awakening the sexual desires she didn't know she possessed. As the killer gets closer to Maya, the intensity of the story revves up a few notches and everyone's protective instincts kick in resulting in a satisfying and exciting conclusion.WITNESS PROTECTION will definitely be going on my new favorites list!

Later, when she's going back to her flat she's kidnapped by them and taken to their lair as food to their Master.With the help of Lucas, The Master agrees to keep her alive for as long as she can entertain them.I really enjoyed Sherry's strengh. She is a tarot Reader and even when she's not sure of where she wants to go she knows what she doesn't want and stands up for herself, or sometimes she also knows when is better to keep quiet and obey the vampires.Lucas is the sweetest guy she ever met. He brings her present daily and makes sure she has everything she needs. We see a part of him, of his past and how he came to be a vampire, however there could have been so much more to his character.The relationship between Lucas and Sherry develops slow, because they both know what they can lose but you can see the insta-love right away.One thing I think would have been better is if it was on a first person POV. As a reader you can only read about Sherry even though the book is told from a third person's POV. It would have been more richer if using the third person's POV, we'd had more insight to the rest of the characters inner workings.The House of Cadamon is a beautiful mansion inside the catacombs where the vampires live. And it's occupants are all very interesting, with different backgrounds. I'd have love getting to know them more, why they did what they did and what they all wanted.The Tarot element was a nice twist for this kind of story and I really liked that part.House of Cards develops in a slow pace but has exciting or important element just in the right places.","05 21, 2013",A1FUCOFJ28UCTG,Cynthia,We All Make Mistakes In Books Reviews,1369094400,1.0,True,3.0

530660,B00CXADBRY,"[9, 10]",4,"I've used Moshi screen protectors in the past and have always been happy with the performance. Their screen protectors are semi-rigid and always optically very clear. This particular protector is for the Kindle Paperwhite and the Kindle Keyboard, which is the model I have.This protector installs like most do. There is a protective sheet on each side of the screen protector. First, wash your hands carefully with dish soap to remove all traces of oil from your fingers. Then, clean your Kindle screen very carefully, making sure there is no oil from your fingertips left on it or fibers/pet hair/etc. Doing this in a room where there are no fans blowing and the air is calm gives the best results.Next, peel off the protective film labeled 1 about halfway. Line up the uncovered half of the protector with the bottom of your kindle screen. When it's perfectly aligned, peel the protective film all of the way off and then apply the protector to your screen. Check to be certain it's perfectly aligned. If it isn't, you can reposition the protector until it's perfect.When alignment is perfect, peel off the top protective film labeled 2. You will likely see air bubbles under the protector. Moshi says to use the included soft fabric circle to gently push the bubbles to the edge of the protector to get rid of them, but that didn't work well for me. I had a flexible rubber tool left over from a different screen protector which I used to remove all of the bubbles. You could also use the edge of a credit card or a small piece of rigid cardboard or (my preference) the edge of a rubber spatula. Once you remove all the bubbles, they don't come back and installation is complete.Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you'll find a bit of lint or pet fur is under the screen protector. In that case, you peel back the protector where the lint is and use the included tape to lift it off of the screen or the back of the protector.This protector has a matte, non-glare finish, which is my favorite, and there are two included in this package.I always use a screen protector on my electronic devices for several reasons. It really does protect your screens from scratches, which are annoying. But also, in the event that your device gets stepped on or sat on and the screen breaks, it minimizes the damage and often, the device remains functional even with a crack. It's cheap insurance, IMO, and worth the hassle to get it installed.","11 28, 2013",A1FDSZISWIXH1A,Terry tcinsatx@yahoodotcom,Wish it had a rubber bubble remover,1385596800,0.9,True,4.0

699051,B00G82TUM8,"[2, 2]",5,"- SPOILER ALERT!! -- SPOILER ALERT!! -Once again Lisa Eugene (Eugene) delivers a novel that's full of suspense, mystery and hot-sizzling passion. In comparison to her last two novels, Surrender My Love centers more on the mysterious hospital deaths than on the budding romance between Brad and Chloe, both very likeable characters. Nevertheless, Eugene does a wonderful job of weaving an intriguing tale that also happens to include Chloe's private and personal struggles caring for her disabled mother, dealing with a brother who's unemployed and who demands money from her on a daily basis all the while ridiculing and demeaning Chloe every chance he gets. If that's not bad enough, Chloe's on the run from the police who want to arrest her for the hospital deaths. Brad, who finds himself falling hard for Chloe, is doing his best to clear Chloe of all the charges, while also struggling to find happiness and balance from his over-demanding career once he realizes that there's more to life than pushing and striving to be number 1. What really makes this story more interesting is Bea, Brad's personal assistant, and Larry, his best friend. The antics between the two were refreshing and added a little comic relief. I only wish they both had bigger roles as I couldn't help but laugh when it came to these two.Like the male protagonists in the two previous novels, Brad is definitely sexy and swoon-worthy, who also has the alpha-male gene in him that's oh-so sexy. As for Chloe, even though I found her to be likeable, intelligent and strong, especially when it comes to dealing with her job and difficult home life, her bouts of crying became a little grating by the end - understandable but still grating.There's one issue I have with the novel which is that neither doctor or nurse had one condom between them every time they had sex. A doctor who's notorious for sleeping around doesn't have even one condom in his wallet, car, or in his apartment? Instead he pulls out of Chloe each time he's about to come. Seriously? And being an inexperienced lover doesn't get Chloe off the hook in my books.At the end of the day this novel is still deserving of the 5 stars I give it.If you haven't read any of Eugene's novels, you're truly missing out. Even though all three novels are stand-alones and can be read in any order, I suggest you start with Strictly Business as it's off-the-charts hot! So totally worth the $1.00 it's selling for on Amazon right now.I've thoroughly enjoyed all three of Eugene's novels and I look forward to reading her next novel which can't come soon enough.","10 30, 2013",A1DU1CJEP60TLQ,Pamela,Another Winner,1383091200,1.0,True,5.0

For once a duchess always a duchess she had thought, until death became the parting from a life she had lived, feared and despised. Even after the death of her husband, a savagely despicable duke, cruel fate deigned to deal a further hand of betrayal. Destitute, Melanie sets out to redeem sense of purpose and reason for her survival from a tragic circumstance that was way beyond her control. Prepared to embrace the freedom to heal from within, she journeys to the wild remoteness of a country house in Northumberland, and there takes up position as a housekeeper-cum-cook. In theory her decision made perfect sense, the reality however proves far more testing than imagined. What exactly her employer does with his time intrigues Melanie, for nothing is quite as it should be at a country estate devoid of horses and carriages, and where visitors are forced to walk from the main gates to the house. Though visitors a loose term, being only one and a close acquaintance of his lordship.Lord Jarrow harbours secrets, too, for a tragedy from his past haunts his waking hours all too often, and more so on dark nights of his riding across heather and furze-clad moorland. To have a housekeeper is paramount in a house, where there8217s a widower, a young daughter, her governess and a lone visitor to cater for. Jarrow8217s needs outweigh anxiety as to whether he can trust Miss Grey, and something about her is most unsettling, not least her propensity for being in the wrong place at the wrong moments in time. Hence security all things a secret pastime could so easily be exposed by an interfering busybody. His daughter, though, is quite enamoured with Melanie Grey, and thereby renders Melanie8217s life more than just bearable despite her employer8217s brusque manner.But, when Jarrow returns with a gunshot wound, Melanie rallies to his aid despite severe misgivings as to his business transactions. And from thence onward their lives become entwined and no way out for either, for once love takes hold, no matter the consequences, when danger lurks a woman must do what a woman must do to save the hide of a loved one. Equally, Jarrow does all in his power to right past wrongs, and in doing so brings ecstatic happiness to the two most important women in his life. Nonetheless, there are aspects of his dark past that remain and continue to slip through the shadows of night. Dark Whisky Road is a thoroughly enjoyable romantic Victorian adventure, in which drip-fed flashbacks reveal heartrending memories as Melanie and Jarrow come to terms with past heartache and untold mental anguish. IMHO, there8217s a touch of the dark and brooding so typical of Emily Bronte8217s writings within this novel.","03 4, 2014",A7UNYP1NEW0IT,FrancineHowarth,A thoroughly enjoyable romantic Victorian adventure.,1393891200,1.0,True,5.0

Sarah has been in love with Chase for years, but she never thought that Chase felt the same way about her.  She's seen him a few times over the years when she comes home, but always keeps her distance from him that is until she returns home.  Chase has been attracted to Sarah for years.  She got away from him before, but the second he hears that she's coming home for good, he knows that now is his time to make his move.Approaching Sarah while she's eating pie at the diner, Chase does what he has wanted to do for the longest time, he asks her out of a date.  They do on the date, but does Chase really care for Sarah or does he view her as another conquest before he moves on to the next girl?This story was short.  When I say short, I mean short.  It only took me about an hour to read mostly because I had to stop in between pages.  I wanted to love this story I really did, but when you are dealing with characters that have known each other in the past and are not just individuals passing through one another's lives, it makes it difficult to connect with the characters.  Don't get me wrong it was cute, but I just expected more out of the story.  The sex scenes weren't that great, and it just wasn't for me since I prefer longer reads.  If you are looking for something short to read, then this might just be the book for you, 3 stars.Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review","07 15, 2013",A2RY8RDPKAE0HD,Rose's Book Blog,My review: Curves and the Cowboy,1373846400,0.0,False,3.0

HOWEVER, in this case I  just flipped back to Amazon and bought the set - it was a sweet deal for so much entertainment.The good things include a well told story, flawed main characters who make you love them, bad guys with depth, and a fabulous cast of secondary characters who added so much zip and sparkle to the story. Drake! Kel! Ethan!  Ana/Sherry/John! I loved them all. More good stuff was the hard won romance and the hot sex - Sloane reminded me of the Brothers from the Black Dagger Brotherhood in his outlook and behavior, though this book wasn't paranormal in anyway - it was just the attitude,A little not so good was the amount of self doubt the author used to move the story along - I wanted to smack both the hero  the heroine at times and say snap out of it! a la Cher in Moonstruck. The other flaw was the pacing of the story. Everything was an Event or a Thing or an Emotion - the story went from one intense scene to another with little downtime for the reader to catch their breath. But these are nits in the long run.

He had issues I understand but if he'd been overwhelmed by love (even if he didn't acknowledge the emotion) he would have been prepared to commit to the h earlier. Yes, he was jealous but it wasn't particularly rational and then he continued with his random dating. I don't think he was a prince to be honest.***Spoiler****I didn't find it believable that the h never had a sexual relationship with her previous fiance. She was no blushing virgin and why was that detail important anyway? I also didn't love the old over-used plot device of having the h get injured in a car accident so that the H would realise his love.

I broke down in a million little pieces.The first reactions were how could it happen to me? How did I not see this coming? Poor me, etc. Luckily, I found the right help in this book8212sound, life changing, insightful advice. It gave me the strength to do two things: keep my marriage together and improve it. As the book says, you won8217t have the first thing without the other for very long.After my husband said he wanted a separation, I came to realize after reading the book that I wouldn8217t keep my marriage together if I didn8217t find a way to make it better sooner rather than later.The first chapter8212How Will You Handle This Challenge? Why Acceptance of the Situation Is Critical to Restoring Your Marriage was an eye-opener. I had always resisted my husband8217s attitude about spending money. I grew up in a family that always handled finances in one way that was different than the way he grew up. This difference in our approaches affected everything about our relationship8212our friendship, our vacations and even our physical intimacy.The book uses examples and stories that greatly simplify concepts and make them real and concrete, rather than relying on pop psychology which is so common in other books. What helped us reduce the friction was the book8217s example of the relationship between a college tennis player and her coach, and how the player could only improve her performance on the court after she ACCEPTED that she needed her coach8217s feedback to improve her game.In a similar way it was only when my husband and I learned to respectfully accept each other8217s opinions without criticism that we could move past many of our disagreements and look for areas we agree on to improve our marriage.The book has been great in helping us focus on what we like about each other. This has led to more quality time together without the negativity to which we8217d been used to for so long.An idea that hit home with me was that my marriage could improve in small steps that I can take, even if my husband doesn8217t want to try anything new. But it8217s up to ME to take those small steps and I can8217t wait for him to do anything.The book was wonderful because without it my husband and I would have for sure split up.

860861,B00IZFK9AS,"[1, 1]",5,"Extraction by Barbie Shannon is a short story thriller centering on an episode in the life of Sally Myers, who is scheduled for a dental appointment at the office of Dr. Shelby. Her experience, or harbinger of events to come, conjures up images of the nuances and anxieties of dentistry from flicks such as Marathon Man to the dark satire of The Dentist. A missing cap from a back tooth forces her to make the trip, and when she overcomes her primal fear of having her oral cavity invaded, the ether-induced sojourn begins.The theme of paranoia resonates throughout the novel as the author takes us through every dark fantasy entertained by patients from the ages of six to sixty-six. Fears of being held against one's will, the dentist drilling too deep or too long, being too enthusiastic or relentless - you name it, Sally's dealing with it. When you think of all the snaggle-toothed or gap-toothed people we encounter in daily life and wonder why they never got their problems solved, after reading this you have to wonder. Perhaps they've been there and decided not to do that.Shannon's tale is a highly entertaining quick read that can be shared with friends and family of all ages. Bring a copy to the dentist's office and leave it in the magazine rack - it'll be the prank of the year.","05 15, 2014",A2BEPH0GY8531W,John R.

I used to read Greek mythology for fun when I was a kid, so this book was like catnip. I don't want to give away the plot, but the book imagines that the old Greek/Roman gods are living on earth these days pretending for the most part to be ordinary mortals. Theo, the heroine, is a classics scholar and Latin teacher who goes back to university to work on a doctorate and gets tangled up in the affairs of ancient gods living as college professors. The book was unabashedly geeky, centering around the university and the faculty, and the hero, Grant, was a total beta - it was a refreshing change from all the MMA fighters, motorcycle gang members, billionaires and rock star heroes currently dominating the romance scene.Even if you don't know anything about Greek mythology, I think you'd enjoy this book, and it might inspire you to read up on it a bit. I did have a few niggles with the plot. In general, Theo is depicted as being pretty strong and smart, however, at a few points in the book, she acts a bit TSTL and out of character in not picking up on certain clues - she's supposed to be an expert in Greek and Roman history and mythology, yet she misses a few obvious things and that annoyed me a bit. If it wasn't for that, I would have rated it five stars, but I enjoyed it a lot and I'm looking forward to more from this author.","07 4, 2014",AIDLVA1QYWTXU,esm4,"A great romance/PNR, especially if you love mythology",1404432000,0.0,False,5.0

It was a deep and inspiring story of love, loss and healing. Both characters have suffered great tragedy and handled their situation in very different ways. While Toby is an over-achiever and Kennedy is the exact opposite, they have one thing in common neither of them really feels anything until they meet each other.Toby is sweet, smart, and a really good guy. He's a bit of an introvert but it's mostly because he is the son of a senator and he has to live his life on the straight and narrow. He has suffered a loss that has profoundly affected him but must suffer in silence because of his father's position. This has caused him to feel this emptiness inside that can't really be filled. He has casual sexual encounters but never holds a relationship because he feels nothing for any woman he meets. He has a passion for film and writing but he studies business to appease his father and decides to go into the business side even though it's not what he wants. I think Toby is a bit of a people pleaser and he doesn't always do what he wants but what others want for him.Kennedy is messed up. I mean this girl has some serious issues and considering the loss she suffered, it's easy to see why. However, I think she is way too hard on herself. She doesn't feel like she deserves to be alive and she relishes in pain and suffering because it makes her feel something and reminds her that she is alive. She has no reason to feel guilt but she does and it propels her into a mess of alcohol and rough, punishing sex. I felt so sad for her because she really doesn't deserve the life she's living and it was rough to see her live her life the way she was.Both Toby and Kennedy are just going through the motions of life but never really living or feeling any real emotions. When they meet, there is this instant connection that neither one of them expects. Toby knows he shouldn't get involved with Kennedy and he tells himself this many times but something propels him to her. Both Toby and Kennedy feel something magical with each other and they really start to build this beautiful relationship and Kennedy finally opens up to Toby and it seems he is making real progress. I was so mad at Kennedy for running when things got real and my heart hurt for Toby because he was really falling for her and letting her go was really hard for him. However, he was always there for her and the way he protected her, even from afar was amazing.I felt like this book had a really heavy feeling to it but it wasn't depressing at all. I really felt for both Kennedy and Toby and found them perfect for each other because they seemed to be exactly what each other needed. Kennedy needed someone who really, truly cared to show her that she deserved to be happy and she had a life worth living. Toby needed someone to care for and show him that he didn't need to be perfect, he just needed to be him. Kennedy motivated him to find himself and be who he really wanted to be. Despite the turmoil of their relationship and the way Kennedy pushed Toby away, I had faith that she would find her way back to him and he could help her reclaim her life and happiness again.","09 30, 2013",A12ZO1K8ZVRBR5,Chelsea C,"Deep and inspiring story of love, loss and healing.",1380499200,0.0,False,4.0

These are great characters that you really like, you want them to be happy and the supporting cast is wonderful.  Riley and Grace are both so afraid of life's disappointments (having been faced with loss and sacrifice) that they are both gun-shy when it comes to each other.  Their Meet Cute is believable , and Grace calling Riley Cute Serious Guy, Cute Brooding Guy and Cute Angry Guy in her head made me laugh.  Riley is home, but doesn't want to be after being medically discharged from the Marine Corps due to combat related injuries.  He wants his mom to sell her BB and retire.  Grace has finally found her home after being on her own for the 10 years since her parents died.  If Riley convinces his mom to sell, Grace is homeless and jobless.  Riley doesn't want to live at the BB and definitely doesn't want to run it, Grace can't imagine doing anything else now that she has moved in to the Snowflake Inn and taken over duties as chef.  It is the journey that both Riley and Grace make together, learning to trust and set aside their respective heartbreaks from the past, that makes this story great.  Samantha Chase never fails to deliver a warm, engaging story with characters that I wouldn't mind knowing in real life.

There are five men in the group, but this story focuses on Beau.Beau Kennedy is the perfect mixture of southern cowboy/rocker.  He is 23 years old, and still a virgin.  Girls are constantly throwing themselves at him, but he wants his first time to be with someone he loves.and that just happens to be the band's manager, Lizette.  He has asked her out many times over the years, but she always refuses.  Beau comes up with a plan-he asks Lizette to date him for one month.  He promises her that if she still isn't interested in him at the end of the month she can walk away and he will no longer bother her.Lizette agrees and soon finds herself in a pickle.  Somehow along the way, she fell in love with Beau.  One of the reasons that she doesnt want to get involved with Beau is because she thinks she doesnt deserve him.  Her parents have always treated her badly, and in her eyes thats how she sees herself.  When the month is up, will she decide to stay with Beau or will she walk away and break not only his heart but hers as well?  How will her choice effect the band?Andria Large drew me into this story immediately.  I fell in love with all of the characters, and I hope each guy will get his own book.  It is safe to say that I am already hooked on this series, and can't wait to read more.

No technology, no transportation besides horses, no electricity and it all resembles those who lived back in the early 1800's except for one thing, there are virtually a very small population of women.  Tami and her companion who was one of the pairs who were sent out to look for help were found by unscrupulous pocket of men.  These men declared them suitable for wives and could care less about the crash victims or what the women thought, period.  Tami was told that she was now married to four men who raped and abused her and her companion to five but she quickly committed suicide.  One of the men that Tami was married to who was kind to her arranged for her to escape and this is when Dan or Tracker as he is known comes in.  The mayor pays Tracker to find his poor wife who must have been stolen by women traders and he loves her so much he wants her back.  Tami is a survivalist and knows how to survive in the wilderness and gives Tracker a run for his money but he does find her and is outraged at the abuse she had endured.  Tracker is part of the Native American clan and wolf pack and knows she is his mate but gives her the space and time to heal and come to him on her own.  I loved both characters.  Tracker for making sure Tami is never troubled again by her so called beloved husband and the others who proclaimed to be hers as well and his softer side of just wanting to protect her and keep her safe.  Tami was fortunate to be on the same plane as two counselors who specialized her sort of abuse and they survived to be able to help her get past her trauma.  They make such a great couple and with time and healing they really do seem to be made for each other.  This book is a bit dark in regards as to these poor women coming across the wrong sort of men with bad intentions and what they endured but it is also about healing and moving on.  I just love this story premise and how unique it is but it is kind of scary knowing with the world we live in today that something similar isn't that far fetched enough to happen in our future.

You absolutely MUST read Sinister Kisses before reading this and be prepared to feel it all- love, hate, anger, sorrow, joy and hope!As much as the feminist in me wants to hate Sebastian, I just can't. He is so beautifully flawed and so amazingly sexy that it is impossible to do anything but love him.Sebastian's love for Taylor is a palpable thing. It leaps off the pages. You experience his passion, his fears, his joy and his anguish as much as if these were your own feelings. He is still a maniacal, sadistic a** hole, but his stock definitely went up in this book.My first impression of Taylor in Sinister Kisses was that she was sort of a weak, pushover. I am revising that impression 110% and offering my most sincere apologies. There is a huge difference between being weak and being submissive. Taylor is absolutely NOT weak. She exhibits a strength in Bound by Vengeance that most could only hope to possess. As much as I want to scream at the top of my lungs for her to run as far and as fast in the other direction, I realize not only does she absolutely breathe Sebastian, but he'd just find her anyway.In true Noir fashion, there are several scenes in this book that will have you biting your nails and others that will have your jaw gaping, your fists clenching and your mind racing.

I like short stories and am coming to learn that there are two different types (maybe more). The first type are those that begin and end within the read. They give you a sense of accomplishment and closure. The second type are those that are meant to continue from a previous book or introduce you to the next in the series. Okay, I guess there are three because there are also those that are meant as in between from one book to another, not really meant for stand alone books. I guess they are something the author gives to their fan base who need more.This short story was the second type. It is an introduction into Cherie Mark's new world of Draghould (her own version of a zombie like monster) and the new dark world of humans. At only 30 pages I felt that Cherie did a wonderful job drawing me into this world and begging for more. I do have to admit I was screaming at my kindle when I realized I was at the end of the short story! This is why I gave it a rating of 3 stars. The ending was just too sudden for me. I have already picked up the next in the series Edge of Mercy which is the first book in the series with 220 pages that I can get lost in.So this story, like I said, introduces us to the Draghould who are zombie like creatures that are driven to infect and tear humans apart. For some scary reason they are extra sensitive to women and go ape shit crazy when women are near. In comes Charlie, a 17 year old girl, who is hiding her identity from the rest of the men in the community and pretends to be a boy. She is trying to look out for her baby sister, she is only 6 months old, and seems to have a hard time `manning up' in front of others.In the story she and her friend, Zeke, come across an old lady in the woods, promise to protect her and take her back to the compound. Charlie learns how bad bringing a woman into the compound is and is about to learn just how much trouble they are in.

Puck is the culmination of evil, using humans as his pawns, seizing control of their minds to thrill in the abject horror her creates and times of war are his canvases. One man has been chosen to rid the world of this evil, but Neil Branch suffers from his own personal demons, his own guilt for the deaths of many and feels unworthy or too tainted to be the one to raise the mystical blade and severe Puck8217s head from his body. His faith is no longer strong enough to heed the voices of fallen heroes who went before him down this dark path. Will there be one who is strong enough to take his place or will years of camaraderie band together a team of warriors who are willing to die for each other to safe the fate of humanity in its darkest, most bleak hour?Travel through time and battle fields from World War II to the Korean War to Vietnam, as career soldiers stand together, and Puck delivers his killing blows, time after time. Caomhnoir by T. Brady is a brilliant dark and explosive read with a constant sense of dread and evil in every page. T. Brady is a master with words, creating an atmosphere that becomes your world until each nerve ending is as taut as a garrote and putting this book down is impossible. The writing is fantastic, rich and full of scenes that feel far too real, with characters that are flawed, yet loyal, brave and willing to march into certain death, so long as their mission is accomplished.T. Brady gives just enough detail to allow the screen in your mind to play back all that his words convey. You will taste the blood, smell the stench of death and sweat in the jungles of Vietnam, listening and watching for the enemy soldiers, dodging the bullets that are shot, feeling them move the air right next to you. The wars themselves felt real, indicating how much T. Brady has invested in creating a memorable tale. With a chaotic feel, scenes change from one war to another, one failed attempt after another to rid the world of Puck. When the end draws near, each twist, each thread is woven together to complete a tapestry of good versus evil, love versus hate, true success versus failure.There are no bright and shiny moments this is dark, dark fantasy that packs a powerful punch with its intensity. It is a battle for the soul, winner take all. If this is an example of T. Brady8217s forceful writing style, I8217m definitely on board to read more from this author.","04 13, 2014",A18JHVX925K101,Dii,Dark Fantasy veiled in Dread.,1397347200,0.0,False,5.0

I would think it had to be very painful as he unveiled his fears and uncertainties in order to share a life of secrets and regret with friends and the public.I read of his experiences for the 33 years of living daily with his alcohol addiction and times of combining the alcohol with drugs. I was astonished at how he was able to hold a professional IT position with major companies while living under or within the influence of alcohol and mood altering drugs. The highs and lows of his depression and self-esteem seem to push him further into the use of more or stronger drugs.In the book, The Courage to Surrender, I felt I was on the journey of memories with John. He stresses the era of the baby boomers or the Woodstock generation as being a time of change when the stigma of using recreational drugs is more acceptable. He reveals the out of control roller-coaster of living a life fueled by addictions, not just to substances, but also the obsession of being able to keep, protect, and help his wife as she spiraled further from him in her haste to escape the all-American dream family into a world of drugs.It is frightening to read of his daily actions of driving while high or stoned, being successful and working among corporate management, and then the nighttime excursions to score more drugs.He writes of the worry and  impact his actions was having on his two children. As you read the book you can anticipate he will hit bottom, but at what cost? Sobriety came with a price and he was willing to make the exchange.  It was not an easy journey, but he is walking it with the help of AA and others who care.If you have a dependency on alcohol and/or drugs or if you have a family member or friend who needs a guiding hand, this book is recommended reading.

She loves the knowledge that she's able to protect humans from the sadistic natures of others.  The downside of her ability is that she feels a need to hold a portion of herself apart from others, including her lover Marisol.  Unfortunately, her well-balanced, compartmentalized life is sent spinning out of control when Marisol is kidnapped and she's forced to turn to Gavin and his pack for help.Wolf Shifter Gavin Ford is Alpha of his wolf pack.  He also works at The Delightful Kitty as the boss's right hand man but the real perk of the job lies in being able to keep his eye on Amara and Marisol.  He's well aware that the women are lovers and Amara insists she has no interest in his manly bits but he's aiming to show her differently.  She might be in denial but Gavin's just waiting her out - sure that the opportunity to prove that she's not as indifferent to him as she pretends to be.Amara isn't used to relying on anyone for anything.  She has very little to do with her own family and Marisol is the only person she truly feels a bond with, however, even with Marisol she maintains an emotional distance and refuses to mate her or consider having children of her own.  When Marisol is kidnapped however, Amara is forced to admit her own fears and acknowledge the fact that she needs someone.  None too soon as far as Gavin is concerned, though the circumstances could have been better.Gavin makes no apologies for being inherently male or very possessive of those who belong to him and as far as he's concerned Amara and Marisol are his.  Marisol's kidnapping and subsequent recovery just allowed him the opportunity to bring the women into his home and show Amara that there's nothing wrong with leaning on someone else or giving in to your desires.  She's not a woman who'd appreciate being coddled and he's just abrasive enough to satisfy her need to be dominated.  The trouble is that Amara still has trouble accepting help in all aspects of her life - something Gavin isn't going to tolerate - and he has Marisol's full cooperation in breaking down Amara's self-imposing demeanor.Mahalia Levey grabbed my attention with her release SATIN AND STEEL and didn't let go until I read every last page.  In fact, I even paid a visit to her website to check and see if there are more titles involving these characters or Gavin's pack.  It doesn't look like it but I've got my fingers crossed hoping for more.  Ms. Levey incorporates humor along with intense emotional angst and plenty of passion.  Of course, there's a lot of lesbian action which is incredibly hot (even if you aren't into girl on girl action) and once Gavin comes into the picture you're definitely going to feel your heart rate accelerate.  Amara, Marisol and Gavin make a wonderful trio and I loved reading about their relationship but I also found myself captivated by Amara's emotional tribulations that stem from her Kanima gift - and her family's attitude about her abilities.  This may be the first title I've read by Ms. Levey but I can guarantee it won't be the last.  I'll definitely be picking up copies of some of her backlist titles and keeping an eye out for future releases.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","01 16, 2013",A2AY83K9N60V38,C.

803119,B00I15VL4A,"[0, 0]",5,"*Dreamy Sigh*Oh, how I do love a good romance. Sharp Love is a historical, Regency era friends-to-lovers romance that simply knocked my socks off. With the combination of friendship, love, and hot intimacy - I just couldn't but this one down and read it all in one sitting (and into the wee hours of the morning).Will and Jack have known each other since they were six years old. The two men grew up in a workhouse together and helped each other to survive through adolescence, but adulthood saw them parting ways. Will stayed in the stews of London, earning money in less than honorable ways as he saved every penny towards his dream of leaving London behind. Jack found honest employment with a Duke, only returning to London when his employer bids him to, and only seeking out Will when he needs his particular help completing his errands. It's on an extended errand for the Duke that Jack seeks out Will again and the two find themselves spending more time together than they have in years, both realizing how much they missed each other and the closeness they've always shared. Each tries try to hide the more-than-friends attraction they feel for the other, but fail when it becomes obvious how mutual their desires are. Companionable days and passionate nights follow, but Jack's disapproval of Will's lifestyle and his single-minded devotion to the Duke's service continue to be large, seemingly insurmountable, roadblocks on the couple's road to happiness.I loved the main characters in this and could really feel that they were MFEO from the beginning. They are very different, but they fit together perfectly in their differences. Will is quick-witted, clearly having both book and street smarts, with an easy, teasing nature. Jack is a big strong man, not as smart as his friend, but loyal to the core and honorable as the day is long. The two complement each other well in temperament, and in the bedroom as well - Will is a take charge kind of guy and Jack gets a lot of satisfaction from following his directions.I would absolutely recommend Sharp Love to lovers of historical romances and/or relationships with a bit of a power imbalance (in a safe, sane, consensual kind of way of course).

Leaving the immortals fighting for existence. Having sought out a solution they rely on an ancient prophecy. Only they are not sure if all the details as the prophecy has been lost.In the third full book of her Night Series, Lisa Kessler tells an exciting conclusion to the prophecy. Except it isn't that simple there are those who wish to destroy the immortals and mankind for their own enjoyment.Muriah La Deaux is the last if her family. A family guarded by the immortals and who hold special gifts. Muriah has visions when she touches an item. A skill she has kept from everyone but has found it quite useful in her career of finding lost or missing artifacts. Of course thus time it may be more dangerous than normal. Her client and sort of boyfriend is dead and a rather freaky man has been hanging out around her home and shop.Issa, god of the west is the god of sacrifice and millennium of doing the right thing has cost him his humanity, for lack of a better word. He has been called to help find, then protect the missing codix and the unborn child. Only one look at the human woman who he will be assisting makes him want to forget all about duty.Muriah and Issa are two hard headed individuals who question that live exists and most certainly don't believe in Happily Ever After. But they do believe in family, loyalty and duty. Somehow that has to be enough. Until Issa realizes that when he is with Muriah he has hope once again. That there may just be more to life than obligations and duty.It's a good thing Muriah has begun to believe in Issa because it's going to take more than luck to contain a god.Another excellent offering from the mind I'd Ms. Kessler.ShauniThis review is based on the ARC of Night Child, provided by netgalley","04 28, 2014",A1HJQ8IXJJ16JN,Shauni,An excellent read!,1398643200,1.0,True,4.0

It doesn't really advance the overall arc of the series, but it features several characters from the full length books. It also dips into the established worldbuilding and the romance provides some great sexual tension and some satisfying bedroom action.The hero of the story is Max. He's one of the vampires who helped take care of Janie in the earlier books. He is tough as nails and built like a brickhouse.  The Kayrs brothers sort of adopted him after he left behind an abusive father in Russia, but he never really considered himself part of the family. He never really let himself feel, until Janie helped open his heart.Now he has a new mission: find and protect a special, enhanced woman who is in danger from the Kurjans.  Sarah was almost killed by them, but when she went to the police, it earned her a one-way ticket to an insane asylum.  Max must convince her to trust him, while teaching her all about the supernatural world she has stumbled into. It won't be easy her own brother is working with the enemy to take her down. But with Jase and Conn around to help, the good guys are armed for the fight.I liked the romance here, because even though Max is tough and powerful, he doesn't feel the need to utterly dominate Sarah.  Even though he knows she is his mate, he gives her choices. He treats her with respect and doesn't threaten her dignity. My favorite line of the book:He had no intention of being a bossy ***hole with her.If only more alpha heroes felt that way! As for Sarah, she is ok.  I didn't have strong feelings for her one way or another, except that I was happy that she accepted Max without the requisite drama of the other heroines, and gave him some happiness.Rating: B","06 25, 2013",ABUY5XK1R4YYZ,Jen Red Hot Books,A strong hero who doesn't have to be a jerk,1372118400,0.0,False,4.0

The variety of topics will certainly kept you guessing. Every time I finished a story I knew I was going to be surprised by what the next one was about. Who would expect a gator wrestler to end up in a fight with lightning wielder?One thing that tied all of Jesse's stories together was the type of characters he employed. Not to say that his characters were too similar, because they most definitely were not, but each of them were, as Jesse puts it, hillbillies with superpowers. The characters hailed from places like the Deep South, Alaska, New Mexico, and similar areas away from the big cities and supposed refinement. For anyone who has lived or visited these places, you'll definitely recognize them, and chuckled at some of the local oddities locals know all too well. Jesse's accurate descriptions and skillful use of familiar culture brought each setting to life, and his unique choices in characters and even more unusual special gifts turned the familiar into something completely new.Reviewing every story in Trailer Park Juggernauts would make this review way too long, so I'll touch on my three favorites and then move on to the book as a whole. So here we go...In Kismet, I really enjoyed the simplicity of its beginning. Checking the mail is nothing unusual, but a young woman checking her mail at night, gives it an edge. Add in a kitten named Monday, purposely injured, and a lurking presence unseen by Catelynn, and I was eager to figure out what Catelynn's power was, because I suspected she was going to need it. Rescuing an injured kitten certainly seems angelic, but only after taking it on a disastrous trip to the vet do you realize just how true that might be. I won't give away the ending, but I did appreciate that softhearted Catelynn doesn't falter when avenging Monday's abuse.Karma's Harbinger, was one of those stories that I started reading, wondering how bored Britney, sitting in her aunt's stifling salon, was going to turn into something filled with battling superpowers. When Tim Reppord, a recruiting office with cryptic, hidden motives, wanders into the salon I had the feeling the next time they met was going to be interesting. When comparing their revealed superpowers it doesn't seem very evenly matched. Britney can dole out Karmic punishment, but Reppord has a much more final power. Their clash doesn't disappoint.My favorite story out of the whole collection was the last one, which was very well placed by Jesse in my opinion. The Velveteen Maraca was the perfect story to finish on. The opening scene presents a couple meeting with their lawyer to finalize their wills. When the topic of handling their remains when the time comes is brought up and Rowland chuckles at the idea of willing his body to government use I knew I was going to enjoy his story. What I didn't expect was how his body was going to be used, and the path that would lead him to become the big-girl sitter for Little Monster. I loved the interaction between the two characters. Rowland's blaseacute attitude about life isn't wholly displaced upon stumbling upon the little girl, but the progressive weakening of disinterest makes their relationship even sweeter.As a whole, Trailer Park Juggernauts was a fun read. I never knew what was coming next, but I like books that surprise me. Jesse obviously has a very creative mind, which shows in his variety of characters and story lines. I'm usually not much of a short story reader unless it's Poe or Asimov, but like Jesse said in his interview, most of these stories wouldn't feel the same if they were any longer.Having said that, I did feel like some of the stories could have been, not necessarily added to, but developed a little more at the end. Roulette in Pestilence, in particular, was engaging through most of the story, but the end seemed to be more of a summary than a concrete ending. I wanted to know more detail about how Tiffany and Shady went about hunting down pimps, and how their mission turned out in the long run.As a collection of short stories, Trailer Park Juggernauts had stories I really connected with and others that didn't grab me quite as much. I think the nice thing about short story compilations is that every reader will latch onto the elements that speak to them. Those won't be the same stories for everyone, but I do think everyone who reads Trailer Park Juggernauts will connect with something different and enjoy the read. It will definitely get the creative side of your mind running around, making you wonder what kind of unique characters and obscure superpowers you could come up with!","02 17, 2012",A29MB4AWTS3H9G,Delsheree D.

But like I say, these flaws were minimal and distracted minimally.Did I like the book?  You bet I did.  This author has a lot of potential in my humble opinion.  She captured the angst of a young person who had been kept in the dark about her true identity....not who she was, but what she was.  Her father may not have known what she was, but the mother was in tune with the past history and instead of sharing the knowledge with her off spring, she sent her to therapy sessions?  Instead of educating her daughter about upcoming events, she made her feel belittled and definitely misunderstood.Who wouldn't feel angered in the same situation?

The wait felt like torture as I8217d been hearing other bloggers talk about it.  Finally a few days ago I had the opportunity to dive in and get lost in this mystical story!This isn8217t your average vampire book and you8217ll find that you get sucked into the story from the first page.  It8217s unique in the sense that there are so many different angles to the story.  While it is about romance, it does tackle family issues, loyalty/betrayal and the suspense is almost unbearable.  There was also the love triangle that I absolutely loved!I loved ALL the characters in this book!!  I even loved the ones I hated!Natalia is the heroine every book should have because she8217s outspoken, feisty, on a quest for her purpose and above all, she wants to do the right thing by her people and humanity.  I absolutely loved the relationship she has with her brother Maddox and the way they look out for each other by listening to each other8217s thoughts.  Obviously that has its pros and cons.  But I didn8217t just love the relationship she has with her brother but it8217s everyone she8217s close to that I thoroughly enjoyed.Finn is the Warrior Vampire that has been in love with Natalia for the longest time and you can8217t help but love him with all his sexiness!  He has secrets which made me doubt if he was all good or not but as the story unfolds you realize he IS good and is simply looking out for Natalia.  But there is another side to Finn, the vulnerable side, the side that is afraid to get hurt by Natalia if his affections aren8217t returned.  To complicate matters, there is True, beautiful True that was spared from being turned into a vampire.  Fate had a different plan for him and it wasn8217t becoming a vampire but instead, a Were.  Who knew a Lion could be sexy!?! There is an automatic attraction between True and Natalia and it8217s not until their paths cross later that we realize how strong that attraction is.I wanted to see more of the love triangle Finn wasn8217t challenged enough and I don8217t think we really got a chance to know True.  With that being said, Finn and Natalia got together way to quick with very little push and pull.  I wanted the tension to be so thick with want that I should8217ve felt compelled to throw my kindle across the room.  That was the only concern I had, the rest was pure reading magic.Janine8217s writing is fluid and the imagery she created throughout this story is absolutely fantastic.  Every character is rich and filled with a mystical quality. This is the kind of book that will whisk you away to place where anything is possible, it stretches the imagination and if you can suspend your disbelief, you will absolutely enjoy this ride.My final two cents: Take a chance on this book because you will be pleasantly surprised.","01 29, 2013",A3C0ENCMXPULA1,Cristina's Book Reviews,Dream-like,1359417600,1.0,True,4.0

No big deal, it happens, so I move on and continue reading.  As I continue reading, the story line jumps from one character's POV to another, to another without any kind of delineation just as a previous reader mentioned.  Again, I brush it off and move on.  I start to discover more and more spelling errors, missing punctuation, and grammatical errors.  This a major pet peeve of mine when reading a book.  As I delve further into the book, I discover the same exact pages that I read in previous chapters, in the current chapter that i'm reading, which causes much confusion.The story line starts jumping around again from each character's POV and it just becomes too much for me and I can't continue on with the book.  As much as it kills me not to finish a book, I just couldn't do it.  It was way too confusing and all of the spelling/grammatical errors just became a turn off for me.I think this would be a great story if the author had just stuck to the POV from the main characters (and not every single person mentioned in the book), and had some serious editing done.

I would think only if love was involved and it is not so much as tame but be of like mind and understand and take them and love them as they are. So in order to have that answered the title alone is intriguing and so into the story I went. I enjoy this author's books so either way I knew I was in a win win situation. Right away caught up in a stampede and who is in charge but a woman who is not afraid in the 1880's running a ranch but faced with some trouble. Catherine in the midst of all hears someone barking his own orders Duncan and she knows him well. Being late isn't getting on her good side either. Trouble has come to their lives and her father has asked for Duncan's help and little does anyone realize at first it is where he wants to be home. Having loved each other long ago but have grown over time and changed and Catherine has become such a strong willed spirit no one can match up in her eyes. But someone wants to take away their ranch and since no men for her and least of all Duncan. John wants to marry her since he can't buy it and Roy is helping for his own reasons and that is to get back at Duncan. Now though she has a very loving and cunning father-James and he has his own plan and that is to get them together to save the ranch. Marriage not in either of their minds oh ugh they might say but that is exactly what is in store. Gotta love it when will children ever learn got to wake up pretty early in morning to try and get one over a parent who knows and loves them well. The story carries you along through all the mishaps and attempts thrown at them. Humor at times that is comedy the interaction sometimes between the two as they match off. Love grows and builds even though Duncan thinks it doesn't exist and she did not want a man to begin with but the fire within them is enough to warm anyone with. The other characters in this story compliment it so well that you find yourself going from one escapade to another wondering have they won yet? Of course no decent story would be with out a climatic ending either and no disappointment here.

It is not necessary to have read the prior books although, of course, reading them enhances this book since the characters from the first two books in the series make significant appearances here.This book is the story of Baroness Marianne Craven, a widow with a somewhat scandalous reputation. She has a secret.  Her daughter was kidnapped seven years ago and she has been looking for her for all that time.  She meets up with policeman Ambrose Kent, an honest hard-working man who cares for his family but agrees to take on an assignment to help his family from financial ruin.  His job?

With war tearing through her country, the forests are disappearing at an alarming rate, and most of the dryads have disappeared to live among mortal people. Dessa aches with loneliness, and her greatest desire is to have a daughter of her own to love and to help her protect the forest. When she meets the American Marine Second Lieutenant Nick Leandros, he warns her to leave the area, but she refuses, believing that she will be able to protect both her forest and the people who reside close by. The airstrike that follows kills the people who refused to leave, decimates her forest, and sends Dessa running...to the mortal world.Nick is wracked with guilt over the death of the shepherd family, especially the children. The resulting post traumatic stress disorder causes him to not only go AWOL from the military, it also changes his very being from man to chimera. Now instead of one, he is three, wandering the world broken and without conscience. It's not until he encounters Dessa five years later that he comes to understand the monster he has become.When she encounters Nick by chance in the Australian casino where she works, something within him calls to Dessa. He resounds of her lost forest. The years she has spent in the mortal world have not diluted her yearning for a daughter, and even though he is unwilling, she knows that Nick is her mate destined to give her a child. If she has to tether him, bind him to her with her dryad magic in order to get what she needs, so be it. They are both broken by war can they possibly make each other whole again? Maybe instead of the bindings of magic, what they need is the healing power of the human heart.********In her novella Wild, Tethered, Bound, Stephanie Draven gives us an intriguing and emotional tale of pain, guilt, and the healing powers of love. This story mixes the brutal realism of war with creatures of mythos, giving us a reading experience that is both pleasurable and absolutely unique. This is no simple throw-away romance. While this novella is quite short, Ms. Draven packs a lot into its pages, and I found myself dwelling on it well after I had read the final page.Ms. Draven gives us strong and complicated characters in Dessa and Nick. Neither is what you would typically expect to find residing within the pages of a romance novel. Not only is Dessa a magical being surrounded with the mystique of an immortal, but she is strong and determined and hell-bent on obtaining that which she desires the most. She is also vulnerable enough to catch our sympathy, especially when she sees how her actions affect Nick.Nick is fascinating. He is a chimera, equal parts dragon, lion, and goat, but he is human as well and a very damaged and fragmented soul. This presents something of a puzzle to the reader. Is he really a chimera of myth? Is the split within him physical or simply psychological? I found myself repeatedly posing this question to myself as I read this story. Ms. Draven does an excellent job presenting Nick as three separate beings who are in actuality one person, and when this spills over into the story's love scene, the results are surprisingly sensual.In all, I found Wild, Tethered, Bound to be readable, entertaining, and quite thought-provoking. The blend of fantasy and reality that this story offers us is exceptional, and the conflict and characters ensnared me.  Ms. Draven is a writer to watch, I believe, and I am extremely interested to see what she comes out with next.","09 20, 2009",A3C2JT2GQGB3E,B. D.

Just because a landlord doesn't require tenant insurance doesn't mean you shouldn't buy an inexpensive policy to protect your legal liability.I have known quite a few good people who were sued by their landlord or their fellow tenants for a fire that started in their apartment and caused damage to the landlords' building, another tenant's belongings, or even damage to a neighboring structure.If you lose all of your clothes and furniture, that is unfortunate, but charities can help you restock your household belongings.  If a court awards a judgment against you, your wages can be garnished for years or even decades to pay back the damage or injuries you may have inadvertently caused,  maybe with a candle left burning, a pot boiling over on the stove, or Christmas tree lights that shorted out.If this author doesn't even know simple and basic legal pitfalls to keep a person out of bankruptcy, I don't trust anything else she has to say, and I immediately quit reading and deleted this book from my Kindle.","07 7, 2014",A1S5XHBZIYOGRE,Rachel Romano,Incorrect information can cost you more than you save,1404691200,0.5,True,1.0

23951,B003YL4KQ2,"[0, 0]",4,"Mr. Von Drehle cannot be faulted for presenting a one sided case to the continuing Civil War over the Civil War. In his books last pages, he correctly points out the fallacy of blaming the Southern Confederacy for all of the faults and immoral acts of the American version of slavery. While he points out the antebellum history of the slave economy in the prosperity of New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Britain, I wish he would spend an appropriate amount of time as he did on the seceded  states.For instance, the New York emancipation act did not free any slaves. It prohibited their children from being born into slavery, a laudible act, however, it did not prohibit the export of current New York slaves to other states which continued to allow their issue to be born to lifetime slavery. Was this the act of freeing the slaves most New Yorkers believe it to be? I see it as more of a Negro Export act which we should condemn with the same breath as any other part of our slave history.West Virginia was admitted to the Union as a Slave state. At a time the Union Army occupied New Orleans, Nashville, and Tidewater Virginia, the Emancipation Proclamation freed not a single slave in the Union or Union occupied territories. Only those in areas of the seceded states yet to be subdued.The other choice he makes is to view the entire enterprise from twenty- first century eyes instead of judging the institution within the context of it's period. In this, he makes the same mistake that he criticizes Jefferson Davis and other Southern apologists from the pre- WWII era for. Slavery was practiced in Africa among Africans and Arabs for hundreds if  not thousands of years before the first Portuguese vessel dropped anchor at Jamestown with the first load of slaves to sell. With the near 100% death rate of Europeans when traveling to the Slave Coast of Africa, the collecting and shipping of slaves to the waiting slave ships was performed almost exclusively by black Africans. Slavery existed largely because those same mosquito born illnesses were also brought over which caused a much higher death rate among Europeans than the Africans who had increased immunity.Thus, this inefficient system turned out to be a relatively efficient system compared to any alternative available at the time. This economic fact forced competing farmers new to the New World to either accept the concept of slavery, or have their children starve and lose their lands. No matter how much an individual vows not to mistreat his slaves, as the generations go on, the economics of the system had to win out.That's really the point that both sides should be able to reach agreement on.","05 20, 2013",A109B7907A98ER,Wood Hughes,Not as biased as most,1369008000,0.0,False,4.0

125260,B005YFBYN8,"[1, 1]",4,"What would happen if a famous female rock star time traveled to Civil War era DC decked out in all her rocker fashion to the Civil War era?  She'll be mistaken for a drunken loose woman and tossed into a cell, that's what.  Oh yes!  This story started out with quite a bang and I loved watching it all go down.This was the sixth book in the Civil War Brides time-travel series and brought together Rayne Green from the future as the romance interest for Sam Powell who has been a minor character in the last few books.  The series of books are so inter-connected that I would discourage reading them out of order.  They build on each other even if the romance focus shifts to spotlight new couples each time.  There is a nice handy-dandy chart in the front of The Rebel Bride that helps keeping the main players sorted because there are so many of them by now.But onward with my thoughts on The Bride Star...Rayne Green finishes a concert and much to the dismay of her friend and manager, Shaye, she goes off with a questionable guy from their highschool days just to let off some steam.  He dopes her up and plans on a bit more with her in an old abandoned building, but she somehow gets away from him and ends up- in the middle of a street mistaken for a drunken whore?  Rayne is so confused and argues with the police officer who puts her behind bars.Sam gets called away from a visit with his friends to take care of a situation developing with a strange woman at the city jail.  He is shocked by her appearance as she adamantly insists that she is not drunk and most definitely not a whore.  Quincy's wife, Victoria, is there to insist that he bring the woman to her home.  He doesn't understand what is going on with this strange woman, but the moment he sets eyes on her he feels protective and possessive.Rayne reacts badly to the knowledge that she has gone back in time and just wants to go home.  She is taken by surprise when the man who brought her away from the prison wants to see her and seems so attracted to her.  Not that she's indifferent, but nobody has ever wanted her just for herself.  Sam is assertive and insistent that they will be together and won't accept that she wants to leave and go home.  A small part of her will admit that she is conflicted about leaving the past and leaving Sam behind.Sam's position as warden of the prison where high profile prisoners are kept keeps him on his toes as a plot amongst the prisoners seems to be emerging.  He and his friend Laughing Crow along with Chris and Clayton try to work out what is going on.  But even this doesn't keep him from pursuing Rayne and persuading her that he loves her and wants to marry her even in the face of his mother's disapproval.  He must even fight Rayne's own personal issues, her secretiveness and her constant threats to run home whenever he upsets her to get the happiness he knows he has with Rayne.  Rayne, with the help of the wise women who surround her, must learn to really look hard at her past and see herself clearly and maybe think hard about what she really wants before she tosses a true chance at happiness aside.The plot on this one follows true to form with the others in that a woman from the future finds herself in the past and a chance at an alternative future if she's willing to take it.  I love this formula and it never gets old for me.  It was thrilling to return to the plotting and scheming of those who would alter history for their own nefarious purposes too with Rayne and Sam right in the middle of it.  There were some pretty exciting scenes and Sam is such a hero and tough in a crisis.As to the characters, I love how everyone is still so very much a part of the story even after they got their own romance.  It's like a big family and so cute.Like I said, Sam is a big hero type.  He tends to be autocratic and over-protective when it comes to Rayne and she puts him in his place for it.  She challenges him to treat her as a partner.  She wants to prove her worth and feel a part of something.  She is vulnerable when it comes to him wanting her for the long haul.  I liked watching him convince her that she is the best thing in his life and that will never change.Trust me, the girl needed a lot of convincing plus she had a few other issues to work past.  Her rock star status back in the future went to her head and created a primadonna attitude that gave me the urge to pop her in the back of the head when she got so caught up in herself.  She would threaten Sam with 'I'm going home to the future because you don't just roll over and give me my way' card.  He loved her and he was strong enough to not let her manipulate him.  Go Sam!  In fact, one of my favorite scenes in the book comes about when Rayne and Sam have a disagreement.  She refuses to discuss it and runs off to make her way back to the future ignoring that a really worthy man has declared his love for her and committed to her and she him.  She runs to Sophie to get her back through the portal and runs right into a verbal smack down that was long in coming and well deserved.  In the end after several bumps in the road, I think they began coming together as a couple in all ways and not just the hot passionate side that they always had going for them.The end of the book set up the next couple and I confess that I am salivating to read it knowing that it will be Shaye and Laughing Crow's book.  This series has me totally sucked in and I look forward to each new segment. Those who enjoy Time Travel Romance with a little spice and sass to their romantic characters should give this series a try.My thanks to the author who sent me the book in exchange for an honest review.","09 17, 2013",A3MT311233OHMQ,Sophia Rose Guest Reviewer for Delighted Rea...,Rock Star Time Travels to the Civil War Era And Finds A Chance for Love,1379376000,1.0,True,4.0

The Noah sisters are witches and every year they compete with one another in a test of their witchy powers.  Crushed follows the sister's latest competition which proves to be quite different than in years past.

Blake does an excellent job of fully developing each of the girls' personalities.  They are individuals each with their own strengths and weakness and this is something that will be appealing to a wide range of readers.

Well in Kara Jones case, she probably wishes she would have taken that saying to heart and left the truth alone. Or just let those dogs that are sleeping in the corner, just lie. Sometimes mystery and wanting to know the truth trumpets all that knows best.Collision by Kate L. Mary starts off with a punch. Our female lead is in a pretty nasty car accident. On her way home from school her Christmas break, her car skids and collides head on into a tree. She is banged up, but okay. During the time in the emergency room secrets are brought to life. Nothing she would have expected in her wildest dream. Kara's dad that she known her whole life is not her dad. Bad Part? You think there isn't something worse than this?? Well there is! Kara's mom has known this little fact for her whole life and chose not to let either him or her into this little secret. Kara's mom, Charlotte has her reasons. Some truths should never be told. Well little Miss Kara refuses to think so and goes on a journey of some unfortunate discovery. Which has her wishing she never made this faithful journey in the first place.I gotta say, when I read the synopsis it intrigued me and what made me want to sign up for the blog tour. I have always been a mystery girl. It was my first love before the Fifty Shades of Greys of the book world. When that came out and others like it, my love of mystery faded like fashion statements. But when I realized that I got two of the same type of genres that I loved, I dived right in. I wasn't disappointment with this book entirely, but I was disappointed with how the female character was portrayed in the book. I completely understand she found a devastating secret about her family and I would be hurt to if that was me. But my God. She put a whole new meaning into the word, Brat. Drammmmmmma was Kara's middle name and that annoyed me. She kept playing the woe is me card just a tad bit too much. If your mother tells you there is a reason for her not sharing who your dad really is then believe her!! Don't make her out to be Satan or the plague. She's your mom, moms have their reason that just the nature of the beast. Now on the other side of the token I would want to know who my father was too, but I would of been upfront with her and told her this was just something I needed and wanted to do. *sigh* Kara was infuriating and almost the reason I couldn't finish this novel, but lets enter the knight in shining armor shall we. Derek was the savior of this story for me! He was funny, smart, geeky and downright sexy. Aww loved him. Derek was admiring Kara since High School. So for their paths to run again after this development was good for Kara. Since she didn't want her mom around and her dad that she thought all along was her dad, abandons her, Derek was a good addition in her life to keep her in check. I liked him alot! I truly think he was the best part of this book.Once the secret is found out, who her dad really is you are basically telling yourself, Holy Shit..this can't end well. In some ways it really doesn't. The way the ending is setup it sounds like there could be a part 2, but looking at the author's Goodreads page it doesn't mention it. Time can only tell. This was a good story with a good pace. I just couldn't wrap my head around Kara. And sometimes you just can't with some characters. Don't pass this book up though because it is still good and entertaining read.Out of a 5.

Actually, the fact that I didn't read the description feed my curiosity. Why? Because Enchanter by Kristy Centeno begins as a contemporary.

The characters are not some teenagers, but younger of 21 years. The idea is that if you don't do what your heart tells, you can lose years that you could spend with the one who can be your soul mate.

Attacks, shadows, unknown, murders begin to emerge and spice the story! You are at the point where you become very curious where we get, what path we will take. Not us, but the course of events. Well, they go straight to fantasy or urban fantasy if you will. The unknowns become mysteries, attackers are supernatural beings, and the attacks get fierce. Disclosures just bring other unknowns and lead to a dilemma: when you cannot be the lover to that person you want most, can you be just a good friend for him?Well, here our heroes find themselves, in an impossible love and in danger of death.The author chooses a solution which, although very possible, it seems a little easier. In addition, in my opinion, some situations brought by those revelations were talking about above asked for a clearer resolution for some of the relationships.I would have liked also that some secondary characters, very appealing, to be more involved in the action and have a more important word to say, even if they will have brought only trouble.The ending you will find yourself if you want to spend a pleasant time reading this book.Hopefully, I could learn how to be the girl I should have been from the beginning, and hopefully, Brandon would come to see how much I loved him.I received the book for review as part of Book Tour - Thank you","03 21, 2013",AMFWL0G2AP5GA,CCAM,Read it if you want to spend a pleasant time,1363824000,0.0,False,4.0

543809,B00D6KEIJ0,"[1, 1]",5,"Before I go on, please let me say how SUPER excited I was to win one of the early ARCs. I LOVE Jus's writing, and have been excited about this title since I first heard about it when I signed up for the cover reveal.Darker Days is one of those books that pretty much has it all. Originality. Amazing pacing. GREAT characters. An awesome storyline. Excellent weaving of threads like an expert knotter (what?).It is also what I suspect to be another GREAT first book in an exciting new series.Ms Accardo, if you spot this review: You rock my socks! Because not only is this book FULL of twists and turns and family secrets, history and mythology (of the religious kind), kick-butt scenes and a whole host of paranormal creatures who are so flambouyantly and vibrantly displayed I could `see' it without even having to close my eyes or squint, as well as one freakin' fabulous crowd of a full-bodied cast ... it is also jam-packed full of LOL moments and has a HOT GUY who is quite literally ... sin.Jessie, as MS, is HILARIOUS, to the point I would like to award her with: `BEST HOT DUDE REACTION EVER!!!!!!!!!' award.Don't believe me? Here' take a tiny peek:Holy house of hogs getting blasted by the blue birdie brigade ...And those little corkers don't end there. They are dotted throughout and at the daftest at times--often when you need the laugh most.Not to mention the dude the above statement refers to. Lucas is quite possibly awesome. I found him cute, and charming, and loved the portrayal of his fight against his sin. I thought it was so subtly welded in with the rest of the text, that there wasn't a single eye roll or neck jarring moment to be had.My only gripe for these two, which I would be amiss not to mention, is that the `feelings' between them seemed to come a little too quick. I'd have liked a lot more `moments' between them first. Because the willingness to each do what they planned to do for the other at the end seemed to be driven what felt like a very power motivation--yet they'd only known each other a handful of days. So something a little more substantial than her attraction to his hotness in the beginning would have strengthened this--but this is pretty much my only complaint.Aside from these two, however, we have the supporting cast. Jessie's friends--great stuff Jessie's family--loved mum and dad and all the issues and complications and backstory that came as a result of having been spawned and raised by those two the funny cop with a crush the best friend of her mum's with a lifelong affection the school friend with flaws even the dodgy evil baddies, with their attitudes and connection with the sin that had claimed them (where relevant).And before I go, let me just take a moment to reflect on this new world Ms Accardo has created. Because, to begin, I thought the pacing was a little slower than I expected, but then I fast understood the reading rate was all me. You see, I DO have a tendency to read slower where there is world building to be absorbed, because I hate nothing more than not understanding the scenes the author has created, and so I stepped back, checked myself, and came to the conclusion that the pacing is brilliant.Oh, and that ending? Yeah, reassures the reader that there is definitely more to come from these characters--and doubly reassures that the next book is going to be a whole `nother ride.I can't wait.Once again: kudos, Jus Accardo.**This review is for an ARC received direct from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

His friends urge him to get involved with another woman, but none have taken his fancy until he recognises a face while out shopping one lunchtime. He's seen her at the exclusive D/s club that he frequents, but never spoken to her until now.ltlt Hello.She stopped, stumbled a bit and looked up. Within seconds, a blush stole across her cheeks. She recognized him, and a jolt of pleasure raced through his blood. >>Bailey has lusted after him for months and never been noticed before she's suspicious of why he now wants to talk to her.ltlt He wanted to tie her up, bind her, shield her eyes and gag her mouth so all that was left was sensation. What he didn't want was to stand in the middle of the sidewalk, shifting from one foot to the other with the silence growing between them. >>He persuades her to have coffee. It's a disaster.ltlt The tensing of her shoulders, the stiffening of her movements when she got up to throw her cup in the trash were all telltale signs. She was ready to be away from him and he couldn't blame her. He was ready for their little disaster of a conversation to be over as well. >>Somehow, he retrieves the situation - and miracle of miracles - she agrees to take him back to her place for sex in the afternoon.

412998,B00B4Y331E,"[1, 1]",4,"Finding Lily by Lisa D. Ellis is a very emotional story that is very likely to break your heart and yet ultimately offer hope.  Claire and her husband Jim had anxiously awaited the birth of their first child Lily and are devastated when they lose her shortly after she is born.  Everywhere Claire turns there are reminders of her baby girl and she outwardly grieves.  She cries and is unmotivated to do anything at all.  In contrast her husband Jim throws himself into his work and tries to move on.  Needless to say this infuriates Claire who feels if he can8217t outwardly grieve their daughter, then he must not have loved her.  Not knowing what else to do Claire escapes to a live for a while in a lighthouse that she had visited and loved as a child.When Claire arrives she revels in the solitude thinking it exactly what she needed.  There are no reminders of Lily here.  The time there will give her the space she needs to sort through her grief and her feelings on her marriage.  As the weeks go by Claire feels certain she can feel her daughter8217s presence there with her and it comforts her.  When she discovers some old love letters of the woman who lives there year round they cause her to reflect on her own marital problems.  Yet she also remembers meeting her husband on this very island and falling in love with him.  Does the loss of their child also mean the loss of their marriage?  Claire just doesn8217t know.Finding Lily isn8217t the easiest book to read at times.  I can8217t imagine losing a child as I barely survived losing my dog.  I did relate to this book in a lot of ways because many, many years ago one of my best friends lost her first baby as he was stillborn.  I was there for his birth and later witnessed much of the same emotions that Claire experiences and it was heartbreaking.I think one of the biggest things to note is not everyone deals with grief the same way in a marriage and this novel portrays that perfectly.  While Claire wears her emotions on her sleeve, Jim does not and neither way is wrong but it8217s easy to see how it can cause conflict in a marriage.  The person literally falling apart simply cannot understand how their partner can go on and live each day as they did before.  I8217m one of those falling apart people so again I identified with Claire.  Ultimately I think Finding Lily is a novel of hope and healing.  It8217s weird to say I enjoyed a book that broke my heart but I did.  I would say that this would make a fantastic book club pick as there is a lot to discuss from losing a child to the effects it has on a marriage.  Finding Lily is well worth reading but have a box of tissues nearby.","02 26, 2014",A2VPX1QH62VSMH,Darlene from Peeking Between the Pages,Emotional story!,1393372800,1.0,True,4.0
